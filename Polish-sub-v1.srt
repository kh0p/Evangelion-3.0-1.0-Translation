1
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:09,476
Ostateczna, stworzona przez człowieka,
wielozadaniowa maszyna bojowa.

2
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:11,144
Sztuczny człowiek, Evangelion.

3
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:13,613
Ikari Shinji...
Będziesz pilotem.

4
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:14,147
Pilotuj go!

5
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:15,815
Nie ma szans żebym to zrobił!
Pilotuj go!

6
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:19,152
Jeśli masz zamiar go pilotować
zrób to teraz. Jeśli nie... wyjdź!

7
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:22,322
Nie mogę uciekać, nie mogę uciekać, nie mogę uciekać...

8
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:23,890
Nie mogę uciekać!

9
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,025
Będę pilotem.

10
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,359
Nasza Eva może pokonać Anioła...

11
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:29,162
Nasza przyszłość zależy od pokonania Aniołów.

12
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:31,631
Piętnaście lat temu,

13
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:33,400
połowa ludzkości zmarła w Drugim Uderzeniu.

14
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,902
Jeśli Anioły wywołają Trzecie Uderzenie,

15
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:37,404
Ludzkość wymrze. Nikt nie przeżyje.

16
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:38,738
Dlaczego tu jestem?

17
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:40,607
Nie wierzysz w dzieło ojca?

18
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,809
Oprócz pilotowania Evy, nie mam innego wyboru, prawda?

19
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:44,811
Mimo wszystko, to jedyny powód
dla którego ojeciec po mnie zadzwonił.

20
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:47,113
Dlatego nie mam innego wyboru
poza pilotowaniem Evy.

21
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:48,815
To czy nadal chcesz być pilotem Evy

22
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:50,016
zależy wyłącznie od Ciebie.

23
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:51,851
Będę pilotem.. jeszcze jeden raz...

24
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:54,988
Nie zginiesz, będę Cię chronić.

25
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:57,190
Nie uciekł od pilotowania Evy.

26
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,694
He chose not to step down of his own volition.
We should entrust this to him!

27
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:02,195
(Toji) We're counting on you!
(Kensuke) Do your best!
(Misato) Good luck!

28
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:04,698
Farewell.
I have nothing else.

29
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:05,765
Ayanami!

30
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:06,900
I don't know

31
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,935
what kind of expression
I should have at a time like this...

32
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:10,570
It'd be best if you smiled, I think.

33
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,074
These poor children's fates
have already been determined.

34
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,975
Captain Shikinami Asuka Langley,

35
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,644
the pilot of EVA Unit 02.

36
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:18,645
Are you stupid?!

37
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,480
So there are actually people
who happily pilot Evas.

38
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,149
(Misato) So, you don’t get along with your father.
(Shinji) He praised me for the first time in my life today.

39
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,484
Well done, Shinji.

40
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,353
I believe it’s the first time
praise has made me happy.

41
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:27,487
The Human Instrumentality Project...

42
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,489
What on Earth is NERV
doing behind the scenes?

43
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,857
Protect Katsuragi for me.

44
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:32,726
Being with Ikari makes me
warm and content.

45
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:34,394
That means you’re in love with him!

46
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:35,562
You’re interesting.

47
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,697
There is happiness to be found
outside of piloting EVA.

48
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:40,734
But Asuka’s still inside, Father!

49
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:42,769
Doesn’t matter. That thing is an Angel.

50
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:43,603
Stop!

51
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:45,572
It’s Father’s fault!
You’re running away again?

52
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:48,108
What’s wrong with running away
from things you hate?!

53
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,776
I don’t want to pilot EVA ever again.

54
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,378
You know, you won’t have any fun

55
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:52,645
if you keep fretting like that.

56
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:55,515
Even if Ikari won’t pilot EVA,
I’ll make it all right!

57
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:59,185
I am the pilot of Evangelion Unit 01…
Ikari Shinji!

58
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:00,687
At least Ayanami…

59
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:01,821
I’ll definitely save her!

60
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:04,691
Go for it, Shinji!
It’s for the sake of your own wishes!

61
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,359
Even if I disappear, I’ll be replaced.

62
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,728
Ayanami! Come!

63
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:10,864
I’m sorry. I couldn’t do anything.

64
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,566
It's fine.
I'm fine with this.

65
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:16,736
It’s the continuation of the Second Impact.
The Third Impact has begun.

66
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:18,872
(Kaworu) Now, the Promised time has come, Ikari Shinji.
(Ritsuko) The world is about to end.

67
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:23,576
Ikari Shinji.
From now on you won't be doing anything.

68
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:25,311
Are you sure I don't need to go out there, Misato?!

69
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:26,813
It doesn't make sense, Misato!

70
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,815
How'd things end up this way?
It's ridiculous!

71
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:31,184
Fourteen years have passed since then.

72
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:34,521
We are Wille, an organization
dedicated to destroying NERV.

73
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:37,023
I'm Kaworu. Nagisa Kaworu.

74
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:39,559
I'm a child bound by fate, just like you.

75
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:41,895
Evangelion Unit 13,

76
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:44,731
for you and that pilot.

77
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,433
Please just don't pilot the Eva!

78
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:47,734
Ayanami Rei doesn't exist anymore.

79
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,735
That's a lie!

80
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,103
Eva Unit 01 awakened

81
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:52,572
and opened the Doors of Guf,

82
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:55,141
acting as the trigger of the Third Impact.

83
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:57,310
You're the cause of all this.

84
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,446
(Shinji) Then I saved you back then, didn't I?
(Rei) I don't know.

85
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:00,947
Let's start, Fuyutsuki.

86
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:01,981
Brat Shinji,

87
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:03,817
are you trying to
cause the Third Impact again?

88
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:07,153
I'll take the spears for Kaworu's
and everyone else's sake.

89
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:09,656
That way, the world will be restored.

90
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,858
Then even Misato would...

91
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,226
Misato, use the DSS Choker!

92
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:15,729
(Kaworu) Stop, Shinji.
(Asuka) Stop, you stupid brat!

93
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,731
What is this?

94
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:21,234
It's the Fourth Impact.
Its starting ritual.

95
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:24,938
Is this my fault?
Is it because I pulled out the spears?

96
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:25,905
I was ordered to.

97
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:29,776
Don't look at me like that.
We'll meet again, Shinji.

98
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:30,977
Kaworu!

99
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:33,646
(Shinji) Nothing good ever came out of piloting the Eva!
(Asuka) You're such a brat.

100
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:36,082
However, there is no unforgivable sin.

101
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:40,687
There is always hope.
No matter the circumstances.

102
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,533


103
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,374


104
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:09,516


105
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:15,855
Paris Assault fleet ready.
Descending at Point 0 of the old city.

106
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:18,725
All ships, assume a defensive position.
Slow forward.

107
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:22,529
Gravity control, autonomous behavior
and guidance system: all clear.

108
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,231
Paris's sky is clear all around.

109
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:27,901
Category 6 core-converted surface.

110
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:31,738
Verifying ship coordinates.
She's arrived at the operation's starting point.

111
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:34,974
Roger.
All ships, switch to alert mode.

112
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,418
Eva-08 and DSRV descending to the target.

113
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:49,789
Eva-08 and DSRV descending to the target.

114
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:54,828


115
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:58,164


116
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:01,067
Landing pad anchors, normal.

117
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,569
The DSRV has locked into position

118
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:06,239
The DSRV has landed.
Analyzing the atmospheric composition.

119
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,641
Oxygen density reads at -3.

120
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:12,145
CO² is tolerable.
We can land here.

121
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,613
Roger. Let's start the mission.

122
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:25,058
It's been 16 years since I last came here.

123
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:29,729
Look at what's become of the famous City of Light...
It breaks my heart.

124
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,098


125
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:34,701
The L-Barrier density is quite high.

126
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:37,270
Restoring the Euro-NERV 1st Sealing Pillar

127
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:41,541
can take no longer than 720 seconds.

128
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:47,647
Why's that?
It's 180 seconds less than planned!

129
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:49,516
Is that enough for them to pick us up?

130
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:51,818
Seriously, I wish the pilots were the only ones

131
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,920
who wore these ridiculous suits.

132
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,823
Shut your yap and get to work!

133
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:02,195
Do you think we'll be able to activate the Anti-L system?

134
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:05,098
A recovery should be possible in stage 4.

135
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:06,866
We should thank our predecessors for that.
--"I leave it to you"

136
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:10,837
We will uphold your wish to save the city.

137
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,572
Let's get to work.

138
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:14,374


139
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:20,613
Well, they're here!
Eva 44A, customized aerial type!

140
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,282
Closing in at 4 o'clock!

141
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,684
Such a splendid front-line formation.

142
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:28,988
They formed a colony by themselves.
They're like a new creature now.

143
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:32,559
I need you to intercept.
Give us 560 more seconds.

144
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:33,626
Yes ma'am!

145
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:37,130
It'd be a pleasure to handle the 44A for you!

146
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:41,101
Alright, Nagara honey.
My cable flight is in your hands!

147
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:43,737
Now let's see...

148
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,944
Direction, turning, tilting...

149
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:55,348
Interesting, but...
This setup is really odd.

150
00:06:55,949 --> 00:07:00,653
I wish they'd at least kept human joint articulation.

151
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:03,690


152
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,825


153
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:09,129
Eva-08, engagement of first wave of 44As in progress.

154
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,197
Second wave detected.

155
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:15,268
As planned, all 44As are attracted to Eva-08.

156
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,604
420 seconds remaining for the operation.

157
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,475
This is so slow, Boss.

158
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,110
It's like working on an 8-bit PC.

159
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,480
This system is as cryptic as the Evas.

160
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,849
It's not easy to control these using human language.

161
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:33,319
Stage 4 clear. We're falling behind.

162
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,954
Stay calm and hurry.

163
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:36,156
Yes ma'am.

164
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:38,458


165
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,061
Maintain speed. Plus 20 to guiding.

166
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:43,730
Keep the current tilt.
Full steam ahead!

167
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,700


168
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,101
You're not getting away!

169
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:51,604


170
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:51,705


171
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:54,274


172
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:56,376


173
00:07:56,376 --> 00:07:59,813


174
00:07:59,813 --> 00:07:59,913


175
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:04,517


176
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,153
Whoops.

177
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:18,898
The 4th wave is coming!
One against many.

178
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:22,769
As they say, "Many a small bird
drive away a hawk."

179
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,772
360 seconds remaining.

180
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:28,942
I can't get past stage 5.

181
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:30,977
You're hopeless, just keep trying.

182
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:34,614
Impossible!
We don't have enough time to replace the data.

183
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,816
Nothing is impossible!
Add more bypass!

184
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,452
But Boss, we just
don't have enough time!

185
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,287
Stop whining!

186
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:43,323
That's why I hate young guys.

187
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,492


188
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:48,228


189
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:49,162


190
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:50,697


191
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,533


192
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,201


193
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,872


194
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,242


195
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,477


196
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,415


197
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:11,951


198
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:21,528
Assholes!

199
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,098
Buncha losers!
Come on, bring it!

200
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:28,568


201
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,905
That was too easy!

202
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,140


203
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,308
What's this...?

204
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,644
Using Angel-style lures?

205
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,212
You little devils!

206
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:47,921
Be careful!
Their leader's here!

207
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:52,892
A military use of the Evas,
forbidden by the Vatican Treaty.

208
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,862
Together they make quite a threat.

209
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:59,499
A ground combat-type 4444C armed with a
positron cannon and 44Bs modified to feed power.

210
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,902
Deputy Commander Fuyutsuki
must be testing us.

211
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:11,244
The 44B's high energy
levels are rising!

212
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:13,413
All ships, take defensive measures.

213
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,316
Prepare for impact and EM pulse.

214
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:30,163
The 4444C is now in shooting position.

215
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,233
The 44Bs are generating a massive amount of power.

216
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,769
It's being fed to the ultra-high voltage system!

217
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:39,272
All 4444C power systems are now online.

218
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:44,444
Positronic acceleration in final phase!
The breech is locked!

219
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:49,482
Incoming!

220
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,824


221
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,707


222
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:24,851
Made it just in time!

223
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:29,489
If they fire again, we're toast!

224
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:32,392
44Bs are generating high power levels again.

225
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:35,228
The energy is being stored
in the high power feed system.

226
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:38,331


227
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,835
Already?!
4444C has started its engine.

228
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,737
It's ready to fire!

229
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:47,140
We're screwed!
Second shot incoming!

230
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:49,309
This is really, really bad!

231
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:54,147


232
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,649
Nagara sweetie, a little help!

233
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,851
Roger.

234
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,561


235
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:15,902
That's not gonna stop me!

236
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,338


237
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:23,610
<i>Excuse-moi Eiffel.</i>

238
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:38,692


239
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,831
4444C has gone completely silent.
Remaining operation time, 30 seconds!

240
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:45,865
We're using C to analyze the algorithm.

241
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,934
We're using C to analyze the algorithm.

- The final lock has been deactivated!

242
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:47,934
- The final lock has been deactivated!

243
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:50,570
Anti-L system, stage 5 completed!

244
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:52,739
It's activating, XO!

245
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,317
Restoring the former city of Paris.

246
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:07,354
Euro-Nerv's installation system is rebooting.

247
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:09,122
Systems are online.

248
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:33,747


249
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:39,919
Good work, Maya.

250
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,188
That was a close shave.

251
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:44,858
Mission complete.

252
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:47,293
Misato, come pick up the gear.

253
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:50,330
Roger.
Hovering down to the supply point.

254
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:51,898
All hands, prepare for resupply.

255
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:54,934
Prioritize spare parts and Eva munitions.

256
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:57,070
Drop the logistic support ships.

257
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,538
The ship is coming!

258
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:02,308
We need the parts to rebuild Eva-02.

259
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:04,310
To the victor go the spoils.

260
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:07,647
Now we have the parts to make Eva-02 like new,

261
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:11,151
and we can modify Eva-08 to make it
Overlap-compatible.

262
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:15,422
Wherever you are,
I'll come get you.

263
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:18,625
Just hold tight, Puppy Boy.

264
00:14:20,060 --> 00:15:46,880


265
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:03,363
Tsch, coward.

266
00:16:03,897 --> 00:16:08,101


267
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:09,903


268
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,944
Sorry, I'm late. Are you alright? Ikari.

269
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:18,745
Hah!

270
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:21,281
Ah-

271
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:23,650
Hey, dogs shouldn't go in there.

272
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,851
Oh?

273
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:26,920
Oh?

274
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:29,990
So, you awake?

275
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:33,526
Don't you get it? It's me,

276
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:36,396
Toji, Suzuhara Toji.

277
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,898
It's been a really long time, Shinji.

278
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:41,901
I was surprised when you were brought in.

279
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:45,772
I did hear about your situation,
but I didn't get much of that weird talk.

280
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:49,943
Anyway, I'm glad you seem to be good.
Can you move already?

281
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:54,647


282
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:57,183
Seems like you can.

283
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:59,919
Well then, shall we head home?
You must be hungry.

284
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:04,524
It's a bit cold outside.

285
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:07,894
Doctor, it seems this child doesn't
want to change clothes.

286
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:09,663
Well, I guess this will do then.

287
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:11,931
Also, we're nearly out of Tamiflu.

288
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:14,734
Alright,
I'll talk with the head of the division.

289
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:17,904
Sorry, but I think
I'll be calling it a day.

290
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:21,074
Well then, shall we go?

291
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,310


292
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,895
There are so many incredible people here.

293
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,863
Is this somehow your first time in a crowd?

294
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:47,267
This is one of the settlements
where various survivors have gathered.

295
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:48,568
The third village.

296
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:50,370
About a thousand people live here.

297
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:54,908
That's a food distribution center.
It gets distributed three times a week.

298
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:57,310
Good morning Doctor.

299
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,814
Oh, Matsukata, already at work?
Please don't overdo it.

300
00:18:00,814 --> 00:18:04,517
Doctor, are those two the kids
that Kredit asked you to look after?

301
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:08,355
Well, something like that.
Please take care of them.

302
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:10,824
Will do.
Well then, if you'll excuse me.

303
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:12,192
Yes.

304
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:15,695
What is "Kredit"?

305
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:19,566
Kredit is a support organization
created by Wille

306
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:21,067
and it doesn't just provide supplies,

307
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:24,404
it also helps with our commerce
with other villages.

308
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:27,874
Our village cannot survive on its own.

309
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:31,478
What is that?
It doesn't look like a dog.

310
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:33,813
Huh? That's a cat.

311
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:35,148
A cat?

312
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:36,683
Is it also the first time
you've seen a cat?

313
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:39,853
There's about ten living under the cars.

314
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:42,822
Here, not only there are cats and dogs,
but they are happy.

315
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:47,560
This here is our house,
and, though it's old, it is nice.

316
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,729
I was given the luxury of a house.

317
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:51,898
We're home.

318
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:53,500
Dinner will be ready soon.

319
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:58,338
Eh, let's see.

320
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:02,942
Sorry to have kept you all waiting.
Please eat while it's still hot.

321
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:07,480
Shinji, you must be hungry too,
yet you haven't eaten a thing.

322
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:12,352
Well, it's fine. Whenever you get hungry,
you can always come here.

323
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:14,754
(Toji) Thanks for the food!
(Old man) Thanks for the food!

324
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,725
So? It's good.

325
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:21,528
It gets weirdly flaky inside the mouth.

326
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:23,530
That means it's good.

327
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,900
Since my daughter has prepared
everything with care.

328
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:31,438
Wouldn't be a surprise
if I had met the best wife in the world.

329
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:34,641
I'm home.
Sorry for being late.

330
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:37,310
Oh! Welcome back, we've been waiting.

331
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,780
Shinji, do you know who it is?
My wife.

332
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,515
The class representative.

333
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:45,018
When I got your message,
I could hardly believe it.

334
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:47,320
Even having them in front of me,
it still feels like a dream.

335
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:50,357
It's been a while,
Ikari, Ayanami.

336
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:52,726
You're wrong, I'm not Ayanami.

337
00:19:52,826 --> 00:19:56,229
What, you aren't? Well...

338
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:57,964
(Toji) Miss Lookalike then.
(Hikari) Miss Lookalike it is.

339
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:01,401


340
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:02,569
What's this?

341
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:06,406
Our daughter Tsubame.
She's so cute.

342
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:09,609
She's a person, yet she's small.
Why did you make her small?

343
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,445
What?
Have you never seen a baby either?

344
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:14,481
When they're born,
they're very small.

345
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:16,850
Babies gradually get bigger.

346
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:27,394
Isn't she cute?

347
00:20:27,494 --> 00:20:30,063
That's right, isn't she cute?

348
00:20:30,163 --> 00:20:32,098
That's because she's our daughter.

349
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:33,266


350
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:35,402
Ah, sorry.

351
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:38,238
Did you get scared
when he got loud?

352
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:41,941
I'm sorry Tsubame,
did I make you cry?

353
00:20:42,042 --> 00:20:43,109


354
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:45,745
Ohh, the appearance of the general.

355
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:48,448
Sorry, I'm late.

356
00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:50,183
Ohhh!

357
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:51,584


358
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:56,823
What is she doing?

359
00:20:56,923 --> 00:21:00,026
Babies drink milk and
grow bigger.

360
00:21:00,527 --> 00:21:05,932


361
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:09,669
Miss Lookalike, you're still no good.

362
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:14,441
I don't get it.
What would Ayanami Rei do?

363
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:17,477
You are different than Ayanami.

364
00:21:17,577 --> 00:21:20,280
So you should be doing what you want.

365
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:25,485
Is it alright if I'm different?

366
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:29,189
 (♪) That's what I have yet...

367
00:21:29,189 --> 00:21:31,224
It's been a while, Ikari.

368
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:33,727
It's Aida, Aida Kensuke.

369
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:35,195
Right.

370
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:40,900
It's Kensuke,
the one who saved you.

371
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:43,570
This "survival otaku" is also

372
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,271
the one who remarkably saved us.

373
00:21:45,372 --> 00:21:49,476
If he hadn't been there, we too
would have died out there long ago.

374
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:58,184
Shinji, it's fine if you stay quiet,
though you should eat the meal served.

375
00:21:58,184 --> 00:21:59,486
That's manners!

376
00:21:59,586 --> 00:22:01,287
Hmm, old man,

377
00:22:01,855 --> 00:22:04,557
I shouldn't have forced him
to come to this dinner.

378
00:22:04,658 --> 00:22:06,393
For today, just leave him alone.

379
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:08,228
But Toji,

380
00:22:08,228 --> 00:22:10,230
to be given this precious meal

381
00:22:10,363 --> 00:22:12,766
and not eat a single bite,
is incredibly disrespectful.

382
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,267
Hey Shinji!

383
00:22:15,402 --> 00:22:18,238
Dad, Tsubame is going to wake up.

384
00:22:18,238 --> 00:22:21,307
Well, let's clean up
and prepare the futon.

385
00:22:21,408 --> 00:22:23,810
Here, for you, Miss Lookalike
and for Ikari too.

386
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:28,481
No, I'll take Ikari,
I think it's better this way.

387
00:22:35,088 --> 00:22:38,892
It was quite unexpected.
The two of them getting married.

388
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:41,861
In middle school,
they'd do nothing but argue.

389
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:45,932
I guess the impetus was
the Near Third Impact.

390
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:48,702
All the hardships after that
forged their strong bond.

391
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:54,107
Ikari, even the Near Third Impact
did not bring just bring bad things.

392
00:23:11,191 --> 00:23:13,793
If we get over this slope,
we'll be nearly there, Ikari.

393
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:20,900
Ah, there we are.

394
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:24,738
It's a self-built house made
using the remnants of the train station.

395
00:23:24,838 --> 00:23:27,974
Feel free to use it.
The toilet is inside that car.

396
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:31,044
I'll get the fuel,
you can go on ahead.

397
00:23:37,951 --> 00:23:40,653
Uhn! I'm naked.

398
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:43,056
How come you're not blushing at all
and don't look impressed?

399
00:23:44,658 --> 00:23:46,026
Good grief!

400
00:23:46,026 --> 00:23:48,361
Kenken really has a thing for picking up

401
00:23:48,361 --> 00:23:49,362
depressed people like this.

402
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:50,530
I'm home.

403
00:23:51,865 --> 00:23:55,268
Yeah, we've got a visitor.
I think he'll be staying a while.

404
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:58,571
For whatever reason, Shikinami
won't show her face in the village.

405
00:23:58,672 --> 00:23:59,572
It's nothing.

406
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:01,775
There are so many Lilins,
it's just depressing.

407
00:24:03,043 --> 00:24:04,044


408
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:09,749


409
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:12,585
Does he only react to the DSS Choker?

410
00:24:16,156 --> 00:24:18,525
Kenken, you're too sweet with him.

411
00:24:18,525 --> 00:24:20,360
Let him wipe himself.

412
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,963
Now, Ikari doesn't eat,
he can't do anything by himself.

413
00:24:24,331 --> 00:24:25,932
A very painful thing
must have happened.

414
00:24:26,032 --> 00:24:28,101
the kind of thing that is not common.

415
00:24:28,101 --> 00:24:32,539
Closing his heart, so no one can see,
is a habit for him.

416
00:24:32,906 --> 00:24:34,307
Just leave him alone.

417
00:24:34,407 --> 00:24:37,577
Though he doesn't want to live,
he also doesn't just want to die.

418
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:41,548
Ikari, for now, this is enough.

419
00:24:41,848 --> 00:24:45,485
Meeting again like this, there's a reason for it.
Count on me as much as you want.

420
00:24:46,353 --> 00:24:47,354
You're my friend.

421
00:24:48,355 --> 00:24:50,991
I'm happy that Ikari is alive.

422
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,862
Hmmm....

423
00:24:55,862 --> 00:25:00,400
Division leader!
You don't have to worry...

424
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:03,436
Ha ha... thanks for
the hard work you do everyday.

425
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:05,038
Goodnight, dear.

426
00:25:06,106 --> 00:25:08,541
What is "goodnight"?

427
00:25:08,975 --> 00:25:12,779
Well, it's a magic formula to
give peace of mind and let everyone sleep.

428
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,448
Goodnight, Miss Lookalike.

429
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,522
Hmmm...

430
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:26,860
Ahhh...

431
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:40,040
Huuu...

432
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:43,043
I have had enough,
I'm tired of pretending to be asleep.

433
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,912
I wonder how long it will be
until I can sleep?

434
00:25:49,983 --> 00:25:54,354


435
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:13,640


436
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,575
Ah, good morning.

437
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:16,209


438
00:26:16,209 --> 00:26:17,877
What is "good morning"?

439
00:26:17,877 --> 00:26:17,944


440
00:26:17,944 --> 00:26:22,082
Well, it's a magic formula to
live together for the day.

441
00:26:22,082 --> 00:26:22,148


442
00:26:22,148 --> 00:26:24,250
Good morning, Miss Lookalike.

443
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:24,751


444
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:28,755


445
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:30,357


446
00:26:30,357 --> 00:26:32,559
Kenken gets up every day at 6AM.

447
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:32,659


448
00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:34,394
He's already left for work.

449
00:26:34,394 --> 00:26:34,494


450
00:26:34,494 --> 00:26:37,063
There's breakfast. Eat it!

451
00:26:37,063 --> 00:26:39,833


452
00:26:39,833 --> 00:26:43,536
She is are a very-tightly dressed girl.

453
00:26:43,536 --> 00:26:43,603


454
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:45,705
Miss Lookalike, who we were asked to
help with by the doctor's wife.

455
00:26:45,705 --> 00:26:45,772


456
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:47,073
Nice to meet you.

457
00:26:47,073 --> 00:26:47,140


458
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:50,577
Miss Lookalike? Sounds like
a name with a story behind it.

459
00:26:50,577 --> 00:26:50,643


460
00:26:50,643 --> 00:26:52,212
Would you like to join a group?

461
00:26:52,212 --> 00:26:52,278


462
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:54,280
You can do some work,
anything you like.

463
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:54,881


464
00:26:54,881 --> 00:26:57,951
Work? If I'm ordered to, I'll do it.

465
00:26:57,951 --> 00:26:58,018


466
00:26:58,018 --> 00:27:00,420
It's not an order,
this is our job.

467
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,021


468
00:27:01,021 --> 00:27:02,422
What is a "job"?

469
00:27:02,422 --> 00:27:02,489


470
00:27:02,489 --> 00:27:04,290
What do you mean "what is it"?

471
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:04,357


472
00:27:04,357 --> 00:27:06,459
I never thought about it.

473
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:06,526


474
00:27:06,526 --> 00:27:09,863
Well, it's something done
dripping with sweat by everyone.

475
00:27:09,863 --> 00:27:10,163


476
00:27:10,163 --> 00:27:11,564
"Sweat"?

477
00:27:11,564 --> 00:27:12,165


478
00:27:12,165 --> 00:27:14,067
Gently using three fingers,

479
00:27:14,067 --> 00:27:14,167


480
00:27:14,167 --> 00:27:17,604
straight from above.
It's a feeling coming from within.

481
00:27:17,604 --> 00:27:20,907


482
00:27:20,907 --> 00:27:23,877
Don't hold tightly,
just accompany it with your fingers.

483
00:27:23,877 --> 00:27:23,943


484
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:25,779
After that, you just have to
get some practice.

485
00:27:25,779 --> 00:27:33,420


486
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:36,723
Your tempo is slow,
try to match with everyone else.

487
00:27:36,723 --> 00:27:36,823


488
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:38,058
Yes.

489
00:27:38,058 --> 00:27:42,896


490
00:27:42,896 --> 00:27:44,331
Is this "sweat"?

491
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:46,066


492
00:27:46,066 --> 00:27:47,901
Oh... oh!

493
00:27:47,901 --> 00:27:50,537


494
00:27:50,537 --> 00:27:51,905
Ahh...

495
00:27:51,905 --> 00:27:53,206


496
00:27:53,206 --> 00:27:55,075
This is a job.

497
00:27:55,075 --> 00:27:55,709


498
00:27:55,709 --> 00:27:58,311
Hahaha, it's a seedling I planted.

499
00:27:58,311 --> 00:27:58,411


500
00:27:58,411 --> 00:28:01,281
That's to be expected.
Here, let me give you a hand.

501
00:28:01,281 --> 00:28:01,681


502
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:04,684


503
00:28:04,684 --> 00:28:07,654


504
00:28:07,654 --> 00:28:11,391
Thanks for your work.
You've met the quota for the day.

505
00:28:11,391 --> 00:28:12,058


506
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:15,362
This is special, since it's your first day
and you have worked hard.

507
00:28:15,362 --> 00:28:17,364


508
00:28:17,364 --> 00:28:19,532
At a time like this, what should I say?

509
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:20,200


510
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,501
"Thanks".

511
00:28:21,501 --> 00:28:22,268


512
00:28:22,268 --> 00:28:23,169
Thanks...

513
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:24,704


514
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,873
Let's all go the bathhouse!

515
00:28:26,873 --> 00:28:26,940


516
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,641
What's a "bath"?

517
00:28:28,641 --> 00:28:32,545


518
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:33,713
This is a bath.

519
00:28:33,713 --> 00:28:37,584


520
00:28:37,584 --> 00:28:39,986
It might be troublesome
if you keep your clothes on.

521
00:28:46,893 --> 00:28:48,862
The bath is wonderful.

522
00:28:48,862 --> 00:28:52,098
Unlike LCL, it's nice and warm.

523
00:28:55,335 --> 00:29:00,373
Me, living without being ordered to...
why?

524
00:29:03,443 --> 00:29:05,645
Being quiet,
lying down in a corner,

525
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:07,981
You just want to show
that you're in pain.

526
00:29:08,648 --> 00:29:11,484
You're impeding my cleaning,
it's incredibly annoying.

527
00:29:12,185 --> 00:29:14,187


528
00:29:14,187 --> 00:29:16,323
Ah, that's not mum.

529
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:19,893
Welcome back, Miss Lookalike.
Thanks for your work today!

530
00:29:20,293 --> 00:29:22,862
Sorry, I'm late.

531
00:29:22,962 --> 00:29:25,398
Ah! Mum!

532
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:29,002
(Mother) Were you a good boy today?
(Boy) Yes!

533
00:29:30,036 --> 00:29:31,271
Hahahaha.

534
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:33,106
Thanks as always, Hikari.

535
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:35,809
It's alright,
the feeling is mutual.

536
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:37,811
Well, let's go home.

537
00:29:37,811 --> 00:29:39,779
Yes! Goodbye.

538
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:41,247
Right, goodbye.

539
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:43,683
What is "goodbye"?

540
00:29:43,683 --> 00:29:47,687
Well, it's a magic formula to
make it so you'll meet again.

541
00:29:47,687 --> 00:29:50,557
(Boy) Hurry!
(Mother) Suuure.

542
00:29:50,557 --> 00:29:52,392
Let's play together at home.

543
00:29:52,392 --> 00:29:54,160
What is that?

544
00:29:54,494 --> 00:29:59,065
Well, it's a magic formula to
become good friends.

545
00:30:12,712 --> 00:30:14,647
I'm already fed up.

546
00:30:15,248 --> 00:30:16,616
Hnngh...

547
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,853
That is not easy on us either.

548
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:27,060


549
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,029
Throwing up again?

550
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:30,730


551
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:31,898
You brat!

552
00:30:31,898 --> 00:30:33,933
Just being fed this kind of meal

553
00:30:34,034 --> 00:30:36,102
you should be thankful!

554
00:30:36,503 --> 00:30:39,572
You're still like the Lilin.
You won't survive without eating.

555
00:30:39,673 --> 00:30:42,475
So eat!
For me, it's always only water.

556
00:30:42,575 --> 00:30:46,112
Before you get a body that won't change at all,
you should taste the awfulness of this food!

557
00:30:46,112 --> 00:30:47,414
Stupid brat!

558
00:30:48,248 --> 00:30:50,016
Not doing anything that way,

559
00:30:50,016 --> 00:30:53,019
is just not wanting to get hurt again.

560
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:55,188
As you're not busy,
at least try thinking

561
00:30:55,188 --> 00:30:57,724
of why I got to the point of
wanting to hit you

562
00:30:57,824 --> 00:30:59,159
at that time!

563
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:01,561


564
00:31:02,562 --> 00:31:03,396


565
00:31:03,496 --> 00:31:05,832
You're too mentally weak.

566
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,069
After all,
since everything you do backfires

567
00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:11,071
and there's no way to recover

568
00:31:11,071 --> 00:31:14,441
and it's all your fault,
you just don't want to do anything anymore.

569
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:18,945
Though it came from your father,
with that level of your mental fortitude

570
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:21,948
I wish you wouldn't have piloted
the Eva in the first place!

571
00:31:33,693 --> 00:31:34,861


572
00:31:34,961 --> 00:31:37,063


573
00:31:44,771 --> 00:31:46,940
Sulk on your own, brat.

574
00:31:47,040 --> 00:32:29,282


575
00:32:29,282 --> 00:32:30,450


576
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:57,210


577
00:33:00,547 --> 00:33:03,750
I'm home!
Ah, where is Ikari?

578
00:33:03,917 --> 00:33:05,518
He left.

579
00:33:05,518 --> 00:33:08,421
I see.
Leaving him be for now

580
00:33:08,521 --> 00:33:10,390
might be the best solution.

581
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,025
Where did he go?

582
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:14,194
To the ruins near the northern lake.

583
00:33:14,194 --> 00:33:17,464
The former site of Nerv's headquarters.
That's also fate.

584
00:33:17,831 --> 00:33:18,765
Rations?

585
00:33:18,865 --> 00:33:21,835
I forced him to eat.
He should last a while.

586
00:33:22,202 --> 00:33:23,737
Thank you, Shikinami.

587
00:33:24,004 --> 00:33:26,573
It's nothing.
It's not like I did it for him.

588
00:33:26,573 --> 00:33:30,443
I just absolutely
won't let him die as he pleases.

589
00:33:43,957 --> 00:33:45,358
My name?

590
00:33:45,358 --> 00:33:49,362
Right, it won't do to continue
as "Miss Lookalike" as you have so far.

591
00:33:49,462 --> 00:33:53,099
Though from what the doctor's said,
it seems you forgot your own name.

592
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:55,835
In that case,
how about giving yourself a new one?

593
00:33:56,903 --> 00:33:59,739
Can I name myself?

594
00:34:08,581 --> 00:34:09,749


595
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:21,328
A book? The one Ikari was talking about?

596
00:34:32,439 --> 00:34:33,873
You picked it up,
you should bring it back.

597
00:34:35,408 --> 00:34:36,743
Thanks.

598
00:34:37,777 --> 00:34:38,978
Do you read?

599
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,748
Thanks.

600
00:34:47,854 --> 00:34:51,124


601
00:34:52,692 --> 00:34:54,561
I have been alone,

602
00:34:54,661 --> 00:34:58,531
until now and from now on,
always alone.

603
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:02,035
That is obvious, Asuka.

604
00:35:03,036 --> 00:35:04,738


605
00:35:07,407 --> 00:35:08,441
Who's there?

606
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:10,944
Me.

607
00:35:10,944 --> 00:35:12,545
Ahh, the First Pilot.

608
00:35:13,913 --> 00:35:15,281
I'll open now.

609
00:35:17,617 --> 00:35:20,153
I have heard that Ikari is here.

610
00:35:20,153 --> 00:35:22,922
He's not here.
He run away.

611
00:35:23,323 --> 00:35:25,325
I see.
Then I'll try looking for him.

612
00:35:25,892 --> 00:35:27,227
Let me tell you something.

613
00:35:27,327 --> 00:35:29,863
We, Eva pilots, are the same as the Eva,

614
00:35:29,863 --> 00:35:32,699
constrained during design
not to surpass the framework of humans

615
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,935
The presence of inefficient emotions,

616
00:35:35,935 --> 00:35:38,838
was just designed to match
the cognitive behaviour of humans.

617
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:40,774
All of you, the Ayanami Series,

618
00:35:40,774 --> 00:35:43,443
You were adjusted
to take a liking to the Third Child.

619
00:35:44,377 --> 00:35:48,448
Your feelings right now
were arranged by NERV from the start.

620
00:35:48,982 --> 00:35:53,186
I see. But it's fine.
Because I feel glad.

621
00:35:53,186 --> 00:35:55,188
Alright. Do what you want to,

622
00:35:55,989 --> 00:36:01,027
The target of your affection is at
the remains of Nerv's Second Branch N109.

623
00:36:01,027 --> 00:36:02,395
Thank you.

624
00:36:03,029 --> 00:36:05,732
If you're going to him,
bring those rations.

625
00:36:05,732 --> 00:36:07,600
Because he will soon be at his limit.

626
00:36:07,834 --> 00:36:10,937
Do you live in this village
and not do any work?

627
00:36:10,937 --> 00:36:14,941
Are you stupid?
This is not the place where I live.

628
00:36:14,941 --> 00:36:15,975
It's the place I protect.

629
00:36:22,582 --> 00:36:23,917


630
00:36:28,021 --> 00:36:29,422
Ikari.

631
00:36:33,827 --> 00:36:36,963
I was told to
"pick it up and bring it back".

632
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:43,103


633
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:50,243


634
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,994
I'll come again.

635
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:33,753


636
00:37:46,032 --> 00:39:41,781


637
00:39:48,088 --> 00:39:50,857
Is it a good idea to leave him on his own?

638
00:39:50,957 --> 00:39:52,892
Leaving him like that,
I think it's dangerous.

639
00:39:52,892 --> 00:39:57,864
For now, let's leave him be.
Ikari needs that kind of time.

640
00:39:57,864 --> 00:39:59,566
Tough, Kensuke.

641
00:39:59,566 --> 00:40:02,402
Aren't you a bit too cold towards Shinji?

642
00:40:02,502 --> 00:40:05,405
Worrying too much is not good
for either one of us.

643
00:40:05,505 --> 00:40:08,241
I'll be going back.
Let's wait and have some trust in him.

644
00:40:08,708 --> 00:40:10,076
Yeah... you're right.

645
00:40:11,478 --> 00:40:15,482
I hope Shinji will start to fit in
with the village soon.

646
00:40:21,488 --> 00:40:24,724
Ikari,
why won't you come back to the village?

647
00:40:27,961 --> 00:40:30,897
You're not doing anything here.

648
00:40:31,398 --> 00:40:34,367
Are you also here to protect this village?

649
00:40:35,268 --> 00:40:37,237
There's no protecting.

650
00:40:38,371 --> 00:40:40,273
I destroyed everything.

651
00:40:41,374 --> 00:40:44,110
I don't want to do anything anymore,
I don't even want to talk.

652
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,278
Don't make anyone else come!

653
00:40:45,712 --> 00:40:49,115
I want to be left alone!

654
00:40:51,418 --> 00:40:55,922
Why is everyone so happy?!

655
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:58,892
Because we like you, Ikari.

656
00:41:00,327 --> 00:41:01,528
What?

657
00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:04,397
Thanks. For talking to me.

658
00:41:06,399 --> 00:41:09,736
This is a magic formula to
become good friends.

659
00:41:09,736 --> 00:41:11,071


660
00:41:12,172 --> 00:41:21,548


661
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:30,190
Huh, is the running away over?
Is it thanks to the First Pilot?

662
00:41:32,025 --> 00:41:33,393
Yes.

663
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,731
Do you feel better now that
you've cried as much as you needed?

664
00:41:38,365 --> 00:41:39,566
Yes.

665
00:41:40,033 --> 00:41:41,234
I see.

666
00:41:41,768 --> 00:41:45,271
Since it seems you can move now,
give a hand to Kenken.

667
00:41:54,547 --> 00:41:58,184
Sometimes driving around is good.
It's a nice change of pace.

668
00:41:58,785 --> 00:42:03,189
I was exonerated from agricultural labour,
the key industry of our village.

669
00:42:03,189 --> 00:42:04,858
Since I'm a jack-of-all-trades.

670
00:42:04,858 --> 00:42:08,294
The main task is an environment check
of the outer infrastructure, for today.

671
00:42:08,662 --> 00:42:09,696
It's restless.

672
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:13,266
...though, the time has come
for the existing infrastructures.

673
00:42:13,366 --> 00:42:15,068
They remain entirely suspended.

674
00:42:15,168 --> 00:42:18,238
Since repair is difficult,
we leave them as is.

675
00:42:28,181 --> 00:42:32,018
I only use branches that have fallen down
or have been pruned.

676
00:42:32,118 --> 00:42:34,754
As we want to keep
the remaining forest safe.

677
00:42:39,626 --> 00:42:43,229
We rely on the water here
for the life in the 3rd village.

678
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:45,598
It's essential to check
the amount of water here.

679
00:42:45,699 --> 00:42:50,003
It truly is the water of life, directly
linked to the life or death of the village.

680
00:42:52,072 --> 00:42:54,107
Take a look at the spring up ahead.

681
00:42:54,207 --> 00:42:57,243
Since the road is harsh for you Ikari,
do some work here.

682
00:42:57,777 --> 00:42:59,779
I'll entrust you
with gathering some materials.

683
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:04,184
No, I've never done it before,
I can't do it.

684
00:43:04,284 --> 00:43:06,920
It's fine.
Tell me once you're done.

685
00:43:10,724 --> 00:43:12,225
Be careful.

686
00:43:12,325 --> 00:43:15,895
Our allotment for a week
is of one animal.

687
00:43:18,531 --> 00:43:21,401
That is Wille's parting gift.

688
00:43:21,401 --> 00:43:25,772
It's Life-Complement L-Barrier
Purification Obstruction Equipment.

689
00:43:25,872 --> 00:43:29,609
Thanks to that, the 3rd village
can live without turning into core

690
00:43:29,709 --> 00:43:31,144
Thanks to Misato and the others.

691
00:43:35,982 --> 00:43:38,151
I have started watching them recently.

692
00:43:38,151 --> 00:43:39,753
They've been named "Infinities"

693
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:43,890
The headless Evas, that were entirely
buried have suddenly started moving.

694
00:43:44,691 --> 00:43:47,027
Today, I'm monitoring them.

695
00:43:47,027 --> 00:43:50,530
As expected they won't come in
here because of the Sealing Column.

696
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:53,266
It's effective even against the Infinities.

697
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:57,504
Even a jack-of-all-trades can't do some things.
If that stopped working, I don't know what we'd do.

698
00:44:01,441 --> 00:44:02,809
As you can see,

699
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:05,779
the situation is that we don't know
for how long we can stay here.

700
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:10,150
But until that time,
the best one can do is live.

701
00:44:11,418 --> 00:44:13,153
That is umeboshi.

702
00:44:13,253 --> 00:44:15,989
Every year my husband
looks forward to eating them.

703
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:21,027
Living is a repetition of
painful and pleasant things.

704
00:44:21,127 --> 00:44:24,831
It's fine if everyday is the same
as today, that's just how it is

705
00:44:25,398 --> 00:44:28,268
I'm at a very young time of my life.

706
00:44:28,435 --> 00:44:31,404
I want to live well in the present.
And I also have Tsubame.

707
00:44:34,107 --> 00:44:36,743
In fact, he is more attached than me.

708
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:40,447
It's alright if Miss Lookalike
remains here.

709
00:44:42,782 --> 00:44:43,983
My name?

710
00:44:43,983 --> 00:44:46,186
Right, have you decided?

711
00:44:46,286 --> 00:44:48,521
No, nothing has come to mind yet.

712
00:44:48,521 --> 00:44:50,790
Well, why not
let someone pick one.

713
00:44:51,791 --> 00:44:52,826
Your name?

714
00:44:53,326 --> 00:44:55,996
Right, I want you
to give me a name.

715
00:44:57,030 --> 00:45:01,067
I want to stay here,
and I need a name for that.

716
00:45:01,167 --> 00:45:03,269
So I want you to give me a name.

717
00:45:03,269 --> 00:45:05,939
Even if you say to give you a name...

718
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:08,375
You are not Ayanami.

719
00:45:09,376 --> 00:45:13,913
Any name will be good,
I want to be named by Ikari.

720
00:45:18,918 --> 00:45:21,788
Is the First Pilot
moving properly?

721
00:45:22,455 --> 00:45:26,159
Yes. She came today as well.
What is it?

722
00:45:26,359 --> 00:45:28,128
Well... that's good.

723
00:45:44,544 --> 00:45:49,082


724
00:45:54,988 --> 00:45:57,390


725
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:03,296
<Right... I can only live at Nerv.>

726
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:17,610
Well then, Shinji.
You have gotten used to this place.

727
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:19,279
Yeah, somewhat.

728
00:46:19,279 --> 00:46:20,814
That's good.

729
00:46:20,914 --> 00:46:23,683
In this village,
many strangers got together.

730
00:46:23,783 --> 00:46:26,486
With everything that happened,
finally everyone could settle.

731
00:46:26,486 --> 00:46:28,521
Was it hard at first?

732
00:46:28,521 --> 00:46:30,223
That's right...

733
00:46:30,857 --> 00:46:32,659
Many terrible things took place.

734
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,863
It became a world where one
couldn't live remaining a lazy brat.

735
00:46:36,963 --> 00:46:39,032
We too had to grow up fast.

736
00:46:39,165 --> 00:46:41,167
We had to be able to do everything.

737
00:46:41,868 --> 00:46:46,239
For my family,
I have done things I am not proud of.

738
00:46:46,439 --> 00:46:48,775
In order to live,
I couldn't afford to remain so naive.

739
00:46:49,642 --> 00:46:53,780
What I do is not something
as praiseworthy as being a doctor.

740
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,349
I play the doctor, help others
using what I have learned.

741
00:46:56,916 --> 00:47:01,354
We have medical care equipment
that Kredit prepared, we're getting by.

742
00:47:01,454 --> 00:47:04,491
Toji, you are praiseworthy.
You are helping people.

743
00:47:05,058 --> 00:47:07,394
There are lives you can't help.

744
00:47:07,494 --> 00:47:10,397
Taking on the sadness
and anger from those times.

745
00:47:10,397 --> 00:47:13,400
I think is the duty of a doctor.
I'll carry on.

746
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,569
I'll have to make amends for what I did.

747
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:18,238
I want to take responsibility.

748
00:47:18,505 --> 00:47:20,907
That's how I'll live.

749
00:47:21,074 --> 00:47:25,578
Shinji, you have already fought enough
for everyone.

750
00:47:26,146 --> 00:47:29,516
From now on,
you can just live here with us.

751
00:47:30,116 --> 00:47:31,251
That's what I think.

752
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:43,463
Thanks for coming along
since this morning.

753
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:48,201
At that time, I didn't think the old man,
who survived the Near Third Impact,

754
00:47:48,401 --> 00:47:51,104
would die like that in an accident.

755
00:47:51,104 --> 00:47:53,173
If it's something like this,
you should talk about it.

756
00:47:53,406 --> 00:47:56,710
I would have liked to have had a drink
and complain a bit.

757
00:47:57,577 --> 00:47:59,646
Your father is still alive.

758
00:47:59,746 --> 00:48:01,147
Even if you think it's useless,

759
00:48:01,147 --> 00:48:03,350
you should meet him once
and talk properly.

760
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:04,351
You'll regret it.

761
00:48:04,451 --> 00:48:08,254
It's too much for him.
That Ikari Gendo.

762
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:13,226
But you are father and son.
The bond remains.

763
00:48:13,827 --> 00:48:19,065


764
00:48:23,236 --> 00:48:26,239
It seems Matsukata's wife has had
an incredibly difficult delivery.

765
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:27,640
Good job!

766
00:48:27,741 --> 00:48:29,743
I'm glad she was born safely.

767
00:48:29,909 --> 00:48:32,278
Even the husband cried tears of joy.

768
00:48:37,283 --> 00:48:39,352
Hey, you, you're laughing.

769
00:48:39,986 --> 00:48:41,488
Yes, she's cute.

770
00:48:41,488 --> 00:48:42,856
Truly.

771
00:48:42,856 --> 00:48:46,126
The size is good,
how about a change of clothes?

772
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:49,663
Yes, let's try some different clothes.

773
00:48:51,931 --> 00:48:54,367
How about these clothes now?

774
00:48:56,369 --> 00:48:58,071
That's nice, it looks good on you.

775
00:48:58,171 --> 00:48:59,406
I knew you'd look cute.

776
00:48:59,506 --> 00:49:00,774
I want her as my daughter-in-law.

777
00:49:01,775 --> 00:49:03,777
Is this embarrassing?

778
00:49:03,877 --> 00:49:05,211
It's cute.

779
00:49:06,046 --> 00:49:08,281
Is this embarrassing?

780
00:49:11,017 --> 00:49:14,154
Sorry, it will be a bit hot,

781
00:49:14,354 --> 00:49:16,122
but put this on for a while.

782
00:49:16,656 --> 00:49:18,558
Since I'm a jack-of-all-trades,

783
00:49:18,558 --> 00:49:21,061
I'm also in charge of contacting Kredit.

784
00:49:26,333 --> 00:49:30,904
The restoration experiments are proceeding here,
where the L-barrier is relatively thin.

785
00:49:31,004 --> 00:49:33,273
It's Kredit's outside lab.

786
00:49:33,273 --> 00:49:37,243
Actually there's someone in the staff
I'd like to introduce to you.

787
00:49:38,545 --> 00:49:40,447
Mr. Aida!

788
00:49:43,583 --> 00:49:45,185
It's been a while.

789
00:49:45,185 --> 00:49:47,153
Is that your new assistant?

790
00:49:47,754 --> 00:49:49,923
Well, something like that.

791
00:49:50,323 --> 00:49:52,726
It's the first time I have met
someone I don't know.

792
00:49:54,361 --> 00:49:58,398
I'm Kaji, Kaji Ryoji.
What's your name?

793
00:50:02,669 --> 00:50:05,271
So, Ikari,
he was a nice guy, right?

794
00:50:05,705 --> 00:50:09,743
Yes,
but he said "Kaji"...

795
00:50:10,143 --> 00:50:13,480
Yes,
he's Misato and Kaji's son.

796
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:17,584
That 14-year-old
doesn't know his parents.

797
00:50:18,018 --> 00:50:19,819
He's Misato's hope.

798
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:24,057
Since she can't do anything mother-like,
she decided to protect the child

799
00:50:24,057 --> 00:50:27,994
just as Wille's leader,
without meeting him once in his life.

800
00:50:29,663 --> 00:50:32,065
Then... what of Kaji?

801
00:50:33,266 --> 00:50:34,601
He died.

802
00:50:34,701 --> 00:50:38,905
Someone had to be sacrificed
in order to stop the Third Impact.

803
00:50:38,905 --> 00:50:43,109
Kaji chose that.
Misato allowed it.

804
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:46,646
Misato deeply regrets making you, Ikari,

805
00:50:46,746 --> 00:50:48,248
shoulder all the blame.

806
00:50:48,581 --> 00:50:50,250
She said it should have been on her.

807
00:50:51,317 --> 00:50:55,488
She doesn't want you to get in the Eva.
Isn't that the case?

808
00:50:55,822 --> 00:50:59,726
Ikari, it's not just you
with painful things.

809
00:50:59,826 --> 00:51:02,228
Misato has also been suffering.

810
00:51:08,868 --> 00:51:11,071


811
00:51:12,405 --> 00:51:13,573


812
00:51:14,774 --> 00:51:15,909
Smell of soil?

813
00:51:18,378 --> 00:51:19,379
Kaji...

814
00:51:20,814 --> 00:51:23,016
Tomorrow, the Wunder
will come for a pick-up.

815
00:51:23,116 --> 00:51:25,151
We've talked about the return route.

816
00:51:26,586 --> 00:51:29,823
It's a record of the village
I was entrusted with by Misato.

817
00:51:29,823 --> 00:51:31,958
Willecray's family is also in the picture.

818
00:51:32,459 --> 00:51:35,228
And also, a letter from Toji's sister.

819
00:51:35,328 --> 00:51:37,497
"Keep an eye on things" it seems to say.

820
00:51:38,565 --> 00:51:39,899
Yes, understood.

821
00:51:41,501 --> 00:51:42,736
I'm home.

822
00:52:01,688 --> 00:52:03,056
Tears?

823
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:07,661
Is it me who's crying?

824
00:52:13,433 --> 00:52:15,735
Is this loneliness?

825
00:52:19,372 --> 00:52:21,741
Good morning, Miss Lookalike.

826
00:52:32,419 --> 00:52:36,256
"Good night, good morning, thanks..."

827
00:52:37,057 --> 00:52:38,291
"goodbye"

828
00:52:43,496 --> 00:52:44,731
Good morning.

829
00:52:44,831 --> 00:52:48,101
Good morning.
What is it? This early in the morning.

830
00:52:48,201 --> 00:52:50,203
I wanted to meet you, Ikari.

831
00:52:53,306 --> 00:52:54,741
Here.

832
00:52:55,075 --> 00:52:58,745
Th..thanks.

833
00:52:59,379 --> 00:53:02,916
Ehm... the name you asked for.

834
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:07,454
Ayanami is Ayanami.
I can't think of anything else.

835
00:53:08,288 --> 00:53:11,891
Thank you for thinking of my name.

836
00:53:12,125 --> 00:53:13,293
That's enough for me to be happy.

837
00:53:15,729 --> 00:53:20,200
I can't live here,
but I do like it here.

838
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,068
Ayanami?

839
00:53:22,402 --> 00:53:25,438
I'm aware that I like it.
I'm glad.

840
00:53:25,538 --> 00:53:28,608


841
00:53:28,708 --> 00:53:30,910
Ayanami? What's wrong?

842
00:53:33,947 --> 00:53:36,349
I wanted to try to harvest rice.

843
00:53:40,987 --> 00:53:44,391
I wanted to hold Tsubame some more.

844
00:53:48,695 --> 00:53:51,865
I wanted to be together forever
with the people I like.

845
00:53:51,865 --> 00:53:53,199


846
00:53:56,936 --> 00:53:58,271
Goodbye.

847
00:53:59,272 --> 00:54:01,541
Ahh, Ayanami!

848
00:54:02,042 --> 00:54:04,644
Right, Miss Lookalike is over there...

849
00:54:04,644 --> 00:54:05,311


850
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,379
What's wrong?

851
00:54:13,853 --> 00:54:15,588


852
00:54:21,061 --> 00:54:23,029


853
00:54:23,129 --> 00:54:27,067


854
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:37,077
All right, all right, all right.

855
00:54:39,379 --> 00:54:41,247
That is the Wunder.

856
00:54:41,581 --> 00:54:43,750
It's huge.

857
00:54:46,019 --> 00:54:48,755
Those with hope of departure are
getting off the ship.

858
00:54:49,089 --> 00:54:51,057
Is it the decisive battle?

859
00:54:53,693 --> 00:54:56,363
Ah, please don't take pictures.

860
00:54:56,363 --> 00:55:00,066
Sorry,
just wanted to leave a record for today.

861
00:55:01,034 --> 00:55:02,902
Right, do as you want.

862
00:55:03,003 --> 00:55:05,071
Mmm...

863
00:55:09,776 --> 00:55:12,278
What are you doing here?

864
00:55:15,949 --> 00:55:19,753
Ikari, you can stay here.

865
00:55:21,354 --> 00:55:23,423
Thanks Kensuke.

866
00:55:23,957 --> 00:55:27,027
Please thank Toji and everyone else too.

867
00:55:29,195 --> 00:55:31,698
Asuka, I'm going too.

868
00:55:32,432 --> 00:55:35,435
Right, well,
this is regulation.

869
00:55:35,535 --> 00:55:36,603


870
00:55:41,041 --> 00:55:42,142


871
00:55:42,242 --> 00:55:46,479
Suzuhara... Sakura?

872
00:55:48,048 --> 00:55:49,649
You left on your own,

873
00:55:49,749 --> 00:55:52,986
you got on the Eva you were told not to get on,

874
00:55:52,986 --> 00:55:55,021
you idiot! Idiot!

875
00:55:55,021 --> 00:55:58,391
You're a total idiot, Ikari!

876
00:55:58,491 --> 00:56:00,026
Are you his wife?

877
00:56:00,026 --> 00:56:01,061


878
00:56:01,161 --> 00:56:06,866


879
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:12,605
Identification of the escapee concluded.

880
00:56:12,706 --> 00:56:16,810
At the present time, I'll be taking over
the surveillance duty of BM-03.

881
00:56:18,945 --> 00:56:24,250
Wartime Major Lieutenant Shikinami,
sign here for the delivery.

882
00:56:25,085 --> 00:56:27,087
The DSS Choker?

883
00:56:28,521 --> 00:56:30,690
No problem with having it unequipped.

884
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:35,028
Until the end of the whole operation,
you will remain in the anti-explosion isolation room.

885
00:56:35,028 --> 00:56:38,765
BM-03, under surveillance,
has arrived in Chamber 2.

886
00:56:38,865 --> 00:56:40,400
Ignition system ready.

887
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,935
Beside removing it forcibly,

888
00:56:41,935 --> 00:56:44,904
that's a more reliable way to handle it.

889
00:56:45,005 --> 00:56:48,708
In Magi Copy was left
the operation history of the choker.

890
00:56:49,476 --> 00:56:51,444
That is,
it shows a situation in which

891
00:56:51,544 --> 00:56:54,214
another pilot blew up
in front of his eyes.

892
00:56:55,281 --> 00:56:59,319
Having experienced that kind of thing,
to come back to the Wunder...

893
00:57:00,286 --> 00:57:01,688
Why?

894
00:57:01,688 --> 00:57:02,689
Who knows.

895
00:57:02,789 --> 00:57:05,725
That I got permission to join
from Captain Katsuragi

896
00:57:05,725 --> 00:57:07,327
is a far greater mystery.

897
00:57:07,661 --> 00:57:11,398
The records from the 3rd Village
and a private message from Suzuhara.

898
00:57:12,032 --> 00:57:13,733
From my brother?

899
00:57:14,501 --> 00:57:15,602


900
00:57:15,702 --> 00:57:18,271
Chamber 2 completely closed.

901
00:57:18,271 --> 00:57:18,371


902
00:57:18,371 --> 00:57:20,640
Ignition system engaged.

903
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:24,577
Isolation of subject BM-03 completed.

904
00:57:24,577 --> 00:57:25,712


905
00:57:30,316 --> 00:57:32,485
No problem with
the cover of the crew disembarking.

906
00:57:32,585 --> 00:57:34,320
Since the two new sites are so cool,

907
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:37,290
beginning, as planned,
the inclusion of Revised 8's power shift.

908
00:57:37,624 --> 00:57:39,859
What's the condition of outside operations
and the main battery tower?

909
00:57:39,959 --> 00:57:44,364
No problems with replacing the fourth
turret and adding the aft main gun.

910
00:57:44,364 --> 00:57:46,433
Eva-related work outside is done.

911
00:57:46,533 --> 00:57:48,768
We're about 3% behind.

912
00:57:48,768 --> 00:57:50,070
Priority to speed.

913
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:51,905
Moving up to one fifth of the checks.

914
00:57:51,905 --> 00:57:52,739
Yes sir!

915
00:57:52,839 --> 00:57:56,776
5 minutes to resumption of
connection work of the second N1 rocket.

916
00:57:56,776 --> 00:57:59,112
Recovery of Major Shikinami is done.

917
00:57:59,879 --> 00:58:02,315
Though, why is that
pestilence spirit with her?

918
00:58:02,415 --> 00:58:05,352
Leave it alone. It's preferable to
having him be of use to NERV again.

919
00:58:05,452 --> 00:58:09,356
At the indicated time for Eva boarding, permission granted
to all personnel for unconditional use of weapons.

920
00:58:09,356 --> 00:58:10,724
We'll be fine this time.

921
00:58:10,857 --> 00:58:13,193
You're just saying that.

922
00:58:13,193 --> 00:58:16,229
When I escaped before,
the captain wasn't able to get rid of me.

923
00:58:16,329 --> 00:58:18,832
But now, that trust has become nothing.

924
00:58:19,165 --> 00:58:21,568
He's just a kid.
Have some understanding for the hesitation.

925
00:58:21,668 --> 00:58:26,239
That kid caused the Near Third Impact
and killed my whole family!

926
00:58:26,339 --> 00:58:28,942
The Near Third Impact was the result,
not his intention.

927
00:58:29,442 --> 00:58:31,611
The Captain is also
devoting herself to atonement.

928
00:58:32,245 --> 00:58:35,348
Right.
Kaji is a person entrusted to Wille.

929
00:58:35,348 --> 00:58:38,251
I'll trust the Captain in all respects.

930
00:58:38,785 --> 00:58:40,987
Everyone is too soft with one's family.

931
00:58:41,654 --> 00:58:45,025
I don't know whose pee it is,
it's the same as this regenerating water.

932
00:58:45,125 --> 00:58:46,893
They think that if you cleanse it,
it's done.

933
00:58:48,061 --> 00:58:49,829
That's not how it works!

934
00:58:54,034 --> 00:58:57,437
Connection test for JA parts for
New Unit 02 completed without problem.

935
00:58:57,437 --> 00:59:00,273
As planned, work on the
independent movement of the left wrist

936
00:59:00,373 --> 00:59:02,142
can begin.

937
00:59:02,242 --> 00:59:06,579
They increased the explosives.
Their trust in us has decreased.

938
00:59:08,048 --> 00:59:09,315
I'm home.

939
00:59:09,516 --> 00:59:11,351
Welcome back, Princess.

940
00:59:11,351 --> 00:59:15,155
Thanks for your journey.
I really wanted to see you.

941
00:59:15,255 --> 00:59:17,557
Dammit! What's with this room.

942
00:59:17,657 --> 00:59:20,393
Instead of decluttering,
do you have even more books?

943
00:59:20,393 --> 00:59:22,696
Books are the aggregation of human wisdom.

944
00:59:23,163 --> 00:59:25,565
Reading widely books
from all times and places,

945
00:59:25,665 --> 00:59:27,334
is my impossible dream.

946
00:59:27,901 --> 00:59:31,571
By the way,
how did it go with Puppy Boy?

947
00:59:31,671 --> 00:59:33,940
Nothing interesting.

948
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:37,610
Oh, you said you didn't care
about boys of his age.

949
00:59:38,611 --> 00:59:42,349
What the brat needs is not a lover,
it's a mother.

950
00:59:42,449 --> 00:59:46,986
All transfers from the supply ships
to the main ship are done.

951
00:59:47,087 --> 00:59:50,890
All logistics personnel on the supply ship,
disembark immediately.

952
00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:52,692
With Kredit's independent management,

953
00:59:52,692 --> 00:59:56,029
Sign here to approve the removal of
all the limiters from both Evas.

954
00:59:56,029 --> 00:59:57,831
Captain Katsuragi.

955
00:59:58,531 --> 01:00:00,100


956
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,936
I validate the approval of both
the Captain and Vice Chief.

957
01:00:03,036 --> 01:00:04,738
Maya, please start.

958
01:00:04,838 --> 01:00:06,506
Understood, Vice Chief.

959
01:00:09,042 --> 01:00:11,644
Misato, when you're alone,
you're always here.

960
01:00:11,745 --> 01:00:14,814
The plate of the Captain's room.
It might be better to change to this.

961
01:00:15,982 --> 01:00:18,518
You won't break your thoughts of
Ryo that easily.

962
01:00:18,952 --> 01:00:21,988
It's not about Kaji.
Being here is just relaxing.

963
01:00:23,156 --> 01:00:27,227
This block was
the original purpose of this battleship.

964
01:00:27,327 --> 01:00:29,195
The preservation of the seeds of all life.

965
01:00:29,462 --> 01:00:34,601
An ark to protect that, with the
possibility of operating semi-permanently,

966
01:00:34,601 --> 01:00:36,569
an unmanned fully-automated model,
the AAA Wunder's original form.

967
01:00:37,370 --> 01:00:38,738
For Kaji,

968
01:00:38,838 --> 01:00:42,242
the continuation of the seeds of humanity
wasn't much of an issue.

969
01:00:42,575 --> 01:00:45,979
He got involved with the Instrumentality
Project and disappeared.

970
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:49,983
The most important thing is leaving the world
in its natural state for all life-forms.

971
01:00:50,316 --> 01:00:53,653
For this purpose, we'll have to evacuate
as many species of life as possible

972
01:00:53,653 --> 01:00:55,355
from the range of the Earth.

973
01:00:56,122 --> 01:00:59,392
This ship was in construction
to carry out this plan,

974
01:00:59,492 --> 01:01:00,727
when we stole it from NERV.

975
01:01:01,361 --> 01:01:05,699
We thought it impossible, stopping the
Instrumentality Project with our own power.

976
01:01:06,366 --> 01:01:10,270
But in the end, by giving up our own life,
we stopped the Third Impact.

977
01:01:11,071 --> 01:01:14,774
An incredibly troublesome man died
a self-contradicting, self-serving death.

978
01:01:19,713 --> 01:01:21,648
The end result is that he isn't here.

979
01:01:22,816 --> 01:01:25,985
And so, I'll use this ship
for the purpose of exterminating NERV

980
01:01:26,086 --> 01:01:29,689
and stopping
the Humanity Instrumentality Project.

981
01:01:29,689 --> 01:01:31,858
For you own revenge?

982
01:01:31,858 --> 01:01:35,061
No, it's not an ark to save life,

983
01:01:35,195 --> 01:01:38,031
it's a combat vessel to rescue life.

984
01:01:38,231 --> 01:01:41,735
That's a really something,
coming from a mother.

985
01:01:42,068 --> 01:01:45,505
I don't deserve that at all.

986
01:01:52,212 --> 01:01:55,115
The Captain and Vice Chief are currently
on the Navigation Bridge.

987
01:01:55,115 --> 01:01:56,983
Nerv's HQ has started to move.

988
01:01:56,983 --> 01:01:58,818
It is thought to be in transit towards

989
01:01:58,918 --> 01:02:01,921
the remains of the South Pole Epicenter,
followed by a soaring Black Moon.

990
01:02:02,856 --> 01:02:05,058


991
01:02:18,171 --> 01:02:22,475
The restoration of the Black Moon,
considered vital for the Fourth Impact.

992
01:02:22,575 --> 01:02:25,445
As well as the Adams' vessels
to be sacrificed,

993
01:02:25,712 --> 01:02:30,417
and the immaculate life-form,
made only of the pure sexless souls

994
01:02:30,817 --> 01:02:33,753
the rebirth of
the Advanced Ayanami Series,

995
01:02:34,587 --> 01:02:38,525
the Humanity Instrumentality Project
such that humans can bring salvation to humans.

996
01:02:39,225 --> 01:02:42,862
This is where that arrogance has led you.

997
01:02:50,036 --> 01:02:52,372
The Third Child has returned to Wille.

998
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:55,108
It seems Ayanami-Type6,

999
01:02:55,208 --> 01:02:58,411
due to a lack of adjustment,
wasn't able to hold her individuality.

1000
01:02:59,479 --> 01:03:05,685
Is it so your son will be experience
the same loss that you did? Ikari.

1001
01:03:11,191 --> 01:03:13,827
He seems somewhat emotionally stable.

1002
01:03:14,361 --> 01:03:18,932
Captain Katsuragi, what do we do with
Temporary Name Ikari Shinji?

1003
01:03:18,932 --> 01:03:20,900
Will you not ever meet him,
same as your son?

1004
01:03:21,401 --> 01:03:24,871
Having him safe in the ship is enough.
There's no need for us to meet.

1005
01:03:25,538 --> 01:03:28,608
Are you still okay with not equipping
the DSS Choker?

1006
01:03:29,242 --> 01:03:32,112
If you have no intention of your own
to make up for your sins,

1007
01:03:32,212 --> 01:03:34,080
there's no meaning to atonement.

1008
01:03:34,481 --> 01:03:37,150
Misato,
even if you try to be cool about it,

1009
01:03:37,150 --> 01:03:40,820
aren't you really happy that
"he came back to you"?

1010
01:03:42,422 --> 01:03:46,059
I have seen that no good can come when
you let emotions get the better of you.

1011
01:03:46,059 --> 01:03:47,560


1012
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,529
As always, you're harsh.

1013
01:03:49,629 --> 01:03:51,898
If I were to spoil you,
no good would come out of it.

1014
01:03:52,565 --> 01:03:53,600
Personal experience.

1015
01:03:58,838 --> 01:04:01,641
Despite not having
any other significant physical change,

1016
01:04:01,641 --> 01:04:04,044
just my hair grows.
How depressing.

1017
01:04:05,879 --> 01:04:10,116
In your hair reside
god, dirt, earthly desires.

1018
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:13,653
it's the representation of
the heart of a chaotic person.

1019
01:04:13,753 --> 01:04:17,290
Princess, without any doubt,
it's proof that you're human.

1020
01:04:27,267 --> 01:04:28,902


1021
01:04:33,206 --> 01:04:37,644
That cursed epicenter
from the Second Impact.

1022
01:04:38,311 --> 01:04:41,114
The Adams' Vessels are all here.

1023
01:04:41,114 --> 01:04:45,318
The restart of Unit 13 is now
a matter of time.

1024
01:04:45,919 --> 01:04:49,189
Right.
Let's begin, Fuyutsuki.

1025
01:04:51,524 --> 01:04:52,892
I leave the rest to you.

1026
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:58,698
So far, everything has gone
according to Seele's scenario.

1027
01:05:04,437 --> 01:05:05,839
Go, Shinji!

1028
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:08,441
Don't do it for anyone else!

1029
01:05:09,809 --> 01:05:11,945
Do it for your own wish!

1030
01:05:17,584 --> 01:05:19,586


1031
01:05:20,153 --> 01:05:24,391
Captain, bad news.
Nerv's arrived at their final destination.

1032
01:05:24,491 --> 01:05:27,193
They're working for
the restart of Unit 13.

1033
01:05:27,727 --> 01:05:31,164
We're left with only a few hours then.

1034
01:05:31,698 --> 01:05:34,067
Yes.
Also, good news.

1035
01:05:34,067 --> 01:05:38,238
Construction of the suspension signal plug was completed.
Both Eva units at the very least. It's taken shape.

1036
01:05:38,705 --> 01:05:41,107
Understood.
All personnel, prepare for launch.

1037
01:05:41,641 --> 01:05:45,612
Suspend operations after 25 minutes.
After 30 minutes, we launch.

1038
01:05:45,612 --> 01:05:47,647
As always,
you're being reckless.

1039
01:05:47,747 --> 01:05:52,519
Departure will be after 25 minutes, with
everyone in second level battle stations.

1040
01:05:52,519 --> 01:05:54,654
Everyone shall finish their work
in 20 minutes.

1041
01:05:55,021 --> 01:05:58,625
Repeat, all ships prepare to launch
in a Type 1 battle formation.

1042
01:05:59,059 --> 01:06:01,828
Finalizing launch position for the unmanned fleet.

1043
01:06:02,195 --> 01:06:06,399
N1 rocket propellant injection completed,
switching to internal power supply.

1044
01:06:06,399 --> 01:06:10,537
Final status check is clear.
All off-ship personnel must leave immediately.

1045
01:06:18,044 --> 01:06:19,245


1046
01:06:20,046 --> 01:06:22,349
That's a few too many,
isn't it, Chief Takao?

1047
01:06:22,349 --> 01:06:26,186
When I decided to stand up against NERV,
it was for our companions who died.

1048
01:06:26,186 --> 01:06:29,189
When we insurrected, what I used
to identify my allies

1049
01:06:29,189 --> 01:06:30,890
was this bandana.

1050
01:06:30,991 --> 01:06:35,228
Yes, we will return to this colour
the land and the sea turned red.

1051
01:06:35,228 --> 01:06:38,298
It's the symbol of a vow
drenched in the colour of that wish.

1052
01:06:39,699 --> 01:06:40,567
Thank you.

1053
01:06:41,701 --> 01:06:44,671
This bandana was a memento
from Ryo.

1054
01:07:03,256 --> 01:07:05,892
Katsuragi, good luck.

1055
01:07:09,629 --> 01:07:13,767
At that time, I truly wished
to stay with Kaji.

1056
01:07:14,534 --> 01:07:15,935
I know you did.

1057
01:07:16,036 --> 01:07:18,405
If you didn't have a child,

1058
01:07:18,505 --> 01:07:19,439
I might have allowed it.

1059
01:07:22,208 --> 01:07:25,311
Because we are at battle stations,
I'm moving to the medical block.

1060
01:07:25,412 --> 01:07:28,081
Ikari, please don't move from there.

1061
01:07:28,481 --> 01:07:31,117
If something happens,
please call me with the red button.

1062
01:07:31,951 --> 01:07:33,687
Well, I'm off.

1063
01:07:33,687 --> 01:07:34,788


1064
01:07:41,361 --> 01:07:44,898
Plugsuits made for extreme depth,

1065
01:07:44,898 --> 01:07:47,334
indeed,
freshly prepared, nya.

1066
01:07:47,701 --> 01:07:49,502
These are unblemished, fresh ones,
right?

1067
01:07:50,103 --> 01:07:51,371
Clothes to die in, that is.

1068
01:07:56,943 --> 01:07:59,312
Activate the new EVA-02 JA reactor.

1069
01:07:59,412 --> 01:08:01,781
Start of stable output energy circulation.

1070
01:08:02,248 --> 01:08:05,452
No abnormalities in the New EVA-08
connection to the air carrier.

1071
01:08:05,985 --> 01:08:08,588
There's no need for a detachment test,
we'll just do it on the spot!

1072
01:08:08,988 --> 01:08:11,224
Last lock bolt of the cage released,

1073
01:08:11,324 --> 01:08:14,394
both Eva units fixed
and placed for launch.

1074
01:08:25,372 --> 01:08:28,775
Four-eyes, I need to make a quick stop.

1075
01:08:30,977 --> 01:08:32,112
Roger.

1076
01:08:35,782 --> 01:08:37,984
(Shinji) Huh?
(Mari) Guess who?

1077
01:08:38,351 --> 01:08:40,620
Hmmm... I don't know.

1078
01:08:41,121 --> 01:08:47,127
A hint: "Rooftop, glasses,
large breasts, nice girl"

1079
01:08:48,028 --> 01:08:50,030
The one with the parachute?

1080
01:08:50,030 --> 01:08:51,064
Correct!

1081
01:08:51,631 --> 01:08:54,734
I haven't introduced myself.
I'm Mari.

1082
01:08:54,734 --> 01:08:56,936
Makinami Mari Illustrious.

1083
01:08:57,037 --> 01:09:00,273
Once again, I'm pleased to meet you,
Wille's Puppy Boy.

1084
01:09:00,774 --> 01:09:02,275


1085
01:09:02,275 --> 01:09:06,613
Huh, you're a bit different.
The scent of an adult?

1086
01:09:06,946 --> 01:09:09,949
That brat won't change so easily.

1087
01:09:11,084 --> 01:09:13,119
For the last time, I'll ask.

1088
01:09:13,586 --> 01:09:16,923
Do you understand the reason why
I wanted to hit you?

1089
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:23,830
When you went out with Unit 03...

1090
01:09:24,531 --> 01:09:26,733
because I didn't make any decision,

1091
01:09:27,434 --> 01:09:29,669
whether to save you or to kill you,

1092
01:09:31,171 --> 01:09:33,540
because I didn't want to
take responsibility.

1093
01:09:35,075 --> 01:09:36,910
You have grown up a little.

1094
01:09:38,611 --> 01:09:40,613
I'll say it, since it's the end.

1095
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:44,684
When I ate your bento,
they were good.

1096
01:09:45,251 --> 01:09:48,088
At that time,
I thought I liked you, Shinji.

1097
01:09:49,255 --> 01:09:52,492
But... I grew up before you.

1098
01:09:54,394 --> 01:09:55,362
Well then.

1099
01:09:56,363 --> 01:09:57,163
Yo.

1100
01:09:57,630 --> 01:10:02,068
You did well.
Remarkable, Ikari Shinji.

1101
01:10:03,570 --> 01:10:05,872
See you later!

1102
01:10:07,407 --> 01:10:10,210
Princess, are you feeling a bit better?

1103
01:10:10,877 --> 01:10:12,912
I am, I'm relieved.

1104
01:10:15,348 --> 01:10:18,752
Both Eva pilots,
begin boarding of entry plugs.

1105
01:10:19,185 --> 01:10:22,689
Shinji, you should find peace
and your own place.

1106
01:10:24,124 --> 01:10:26,393
Fate will guide you.

1107
01:10:28,395 --> 01:10:30,063
We will meet again.

1108
01:10:31,631 --> 01:10:35,902
Yes... that's right, Kaworu.

1109
01:10:37,871 --> 01:10:41,474
Machine exceeding critical point.

1110
01:10:41,574 --> 01:10:44,277
Ascending thrust, 11.6 million tons.

1111
01:10:44,277 --> 01:10:48,448
No problem with the steering,
gyro-compass movements and gravity control.

1112
01:10:48,548 --> 01:10:52,352
Eva units fixing to launch positions
completed, entry starting.

1113
01:10:52,452 --> 01:10:55,822
Energy transmission normal.

1114
01:10:55,822 --> 01:10:58,892
Unmanned fleet,
all ship fixed in firing position.

1115
01:10:58,992 --> 01:11:03,029
Operations outside suspended,
emergency personnel standing by.

1116
01:11:03,029 --> 01:11:05,999
Transition to battle formation
Type-1 completed.

1117
01:11:06,533 --> 01:11:09,269
Captain,
the whole ship is ready for launch.

1118
01:11:09,369 --> 01:11:11,905
We can attack Nerv's HQ at any time.

1119
01:11:11,905 --> 01:11:13,306
Understood.

1120
01:11:13,306 --> 01:11:16,443
Message from the captain.
From now on,

1121
01:11:16,443 --> 01:11:18,778
this battleship will assault Nerv's HQ,

1122
01:11:18,878 --> 01:11:23,316
currently at the South Pole,
to prevent the irreversible Fourth Impact.

1123
01:11:23,316 --> 01:11:24,651
The objective is the neutralization of

1124
01:11:24,751 --> 01:11:27,487
Eva Unit 13, that will become
the trigger for the ritual.

1125
01:11:27,587 --> 01:11:29,823
Starting operation Yamato.

1126
01:11:29,823 --> 01:11:32,859
We'll bring an end to all the chaos so far.

1127
01:11:33,626 --> 01:11:36,029
All ships, launch!

1128
01:11:36,029 --> 01:12:12,699


1129
01:12:12,699 --> 01:12:14,067
Entry complete.

1130
01:12:14,067 --> 01:12:14,167


1131
01:12:14,167 --> 01:12:16,836
Completed transition of the command center
to the battle bridge.

1132
01:12:16,836 --> 01:12:16,903


1133
01:12:16,903 --> 01:12:19,973
Entering release point for
seeds containment units.

1134
01:12:19,973 --> 01:12:20,073


1135
01:12:20,073 --> 01:12:22,942
Understood.
Cut the link to the Wunder.

1136
01:12:22,942 --> 01:12:23,043


1137
01:12:23,043 --> 01:12:26,546
Switching to internal battery and
control system to independent system.

1138
01:12:26,546 --> 01:12:27,313


1139
01:12:27,313 --> 01:12:29,516
All seed units ejected.

1140
01:12:29,516 --> 01:13:00,580


1141
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:03,116
Completed injection to L5 of all blocks.

1142
01:13:03,116 --> 01:13:03,183


1143
01:13:03,183 --> 01:13:04,751
No issues with self-adjustment.

1144
01:13:04,751 --> 01:13:06,319


1145
01:13:06,319 --> 01:13:10,023
Beginning descent to target location.
Breaking into the atmosphere.

1146
01:13:10,023 --> 01:13:10,123


1147
01:13:10,123 --> 01:13:12,525
Understood,
beginning entry into the atmosphere.

1148
01:13:12,525 --> 01:13:28,708


1149
01:13:28,708 --> 01:13:30,744
Monitors restored.

1150
01:13:30,744 --> 01:13:33,046


1151
01:13:33,046 --> 01:13:37,083
Approaching South Pole Epicenter,
entering L-Barrier limit surface.

1152
01:13:37,083 --> 01:13:47,994


1153
01:13:47,994 --> 01:13:51,231
Cruising through the barrier
with no issues.

1154
01:13:51,231 --> 01:13:51,231


1155
01:13:51,331 --> 01:13:56,036
Over the L-Barrier, that is there to stop
the life stained with the original sin.

1156
01:13:58,238 --> 01:14:00,440
We proceed without blessing to this area

1157
01:14:00,573 --> 01:14:02,475
that was cleansed of humanity.

1158
01:14:02,942 --> 01:14:05,645
It's thanks to Kaji's data
and the Anti-L System.

1159
01:14:05,645 --> 01:14:08,615
Still 20 to the possible point of
underwater navigation of the L-barrier.

1160
01:14:08,615 --> 01:14:10,984
Understood,
everyone prepare for underwater navigation.

1161
01:14:11,818 --> 01:14:13,186


1162
01:14:13,286 --> 01:14:14,754


1163
01:14:15,121 --> 01:14:17,724
Starboard second hull was shot!
Damage unknown!

1164
01:14:17,824 --> 01:14:19,559
We've found the shadow of
a ship at 3 o'clock!

1165
01:14:23,029 --> 01:14:25,865
Opfer-type equipped model 2 ship,
Erlösung!

1166
01:14:26,499 --> 01:14:28,001
Of course it was completed.

1167
01:14:28,568 --> 01:14:29,936
Sorry.

1168
01:14:30,036 --> 01:14:32,906
I'll go along with Ikari's selfishness
for a little longer.

1169
01:14:36,876 --> 01:14:39,646
Holding out until the reboot of Unit 13?

1170
01:14:39,646 --> 01:14:42,349
The same god-killing power,
how troublesome.

1171
01:14:42,449 --> 01:14:43,850


1172
01:14:43,850 --> 01:14:45,352


1173
01:14:45,452 --> 01:14:48,988
While keeping Nerv's ship in check,
hurry to the immersion point.

1174
01:14:48,988 --> 01:14:49,856
Attack!

1175
01:14:49,956 --> 01:14:53,526


1176
01:14:53,526 --> 01:14:56,129


1177
01:14:59,366 --> 01:15:01,034


1178
01:15:03,770 --> 01:15:05,705


1179
01:15:07,574 --> 01:15:09,642


1180
01:15:10,543 --> 01:15:13,947
We're getting shot from everywhere,
their firepower is overwhelming!

1181
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:16,483
Damn, there's ships of
that same type somewhere!

1182
01:15:16,483 --> 01:15:18,852
There's a difference between
complete or incomplete.

1183
01:15:18,852 --> 01:15:22,422
Then the main ship is above!

1184
01:15:25,825 --> 01:15:28,395


1185
01:15:29,029 --> 01:15:31,564
We've reached the L-Barrier
immersion point.

1186
01:15:31,564 --> 01:15:32,766
Submerge quickly!

1187
01:15:32,766 --> 01:15:33,767
Understood.

1188
01:15:46,279 --> 01:15:48,148
We've surpassed the first layer
of the L-Barrier.

1189
01:15:50,450 --> 01:15:53,820
Breaking into second layer;
L-Barrier density plus 30.

1190
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:57,023
Large number of Eva Infinity at 12 o'clock.

1191
01:15:57,123 --> 01:15:59,292
Don't mind that! Keep going!

1192
01:16:05,098 --> 01:16:07,901
At our 12 o'clock,
the shadow of a ship has appeared!

1193
01:16:07,901 --> 01:16:08,835
An ambush?

1194
01:16:12,505 --> 01:16:16,209
Three Erbsünde ships,
a successful pincer attack.

1195
01:16:18,144 --> 01:16:19,412


1196
01:16:19,746 --> 01:16:20,580


1197
01:16:21,548 --> 01:16:24,684
It's bad! If we get hit more than this,
it will hinder the navigation.

1198
01:16:25,118 --> 01:16:29,990
Keep the rudder as is, and proceed
at maximum battle speed!

1199
01:16:29,990 --> 01:16:31,358
Understood!

1200
01:16:42,035 --> 01:16:43,570
Third ship, evasive maneuver!

1201
01:16:45,672 --> 01:16:47,874
Don't let them escape!
This way we'll crash into them!

1202
01:16:52,045 --> 01:16:54,080


1203
01:16:55,515 --> 01:16:57,684


1204
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:03,523
Rotate the ship!
180° roll!

1205
01:17:03,890 --> 01:17:05,558
Change stance with the enemy ship!

1206
01:17:05,558 --> 01:17:07,027
Understood.

1207
01:17:23,476 --> 01:17:25,779
Will he use the third ship as shield...

1208
01:17:25,879 --> 01:17:28,481
As always you act rashly.

1209
01:17:34,487 --> 01:17:36,556
We've passed the group of Infinity!

1210
01:17:36,656 --> 01:17:38,825
Passing the third layer of the B-Barrier!

1211
01:17:39,025 --> 01:17:41,027
Recognised our objective, Nerv's HQ.

1212
01:17:41,127 --> 01:17:43,563
Already below the Black Moon,
it's shifting.

1213
01:17:44,631 --> 01:17:47,067
Unit 13 restart is close.

1214
01:17:47,167 --> 01:17:50,236
Ship 2 and 3 are getting
closer from the stern.

1215
01:17:50,337 --> 01:17:54,908
There's no time make course to Nerv's HQ,
using the Black Moon as shield.

1216
01:17:55,241 --> 01:17:59,713
Preparing guided missiles,
aiming at Unit 13.

1217
01:18:00,046 --> 01:18:02,782
From our 6 o'clock,
Nerv's fleet is approaching!

1218
01:18:03,016 --> 01:18:03,950


1219
01:18:04,584 --> 01:18:07,487
Tilt the ship to keep the area
getting shot to a minimum.

1220
01:18:07,587 --> 01:18:09,189
Understood!

1221
01:18:09,189 --> 01:18:12,392
The stern gravity ballast was hit, down 20.

1222
01:18:12,392 --> 01:18:16,696
Focus the AT Field on protecting
the fleet above the main wings of ship.

1223
01:18:19,332 --> 01:18:20,533


1224
01:18:22,268 --> 01:18:24,237


1225
01:18:24,337 --> 01:18:27,807
Serious damage to the main battery
in the rear. We're getting beaten up!

1226
01:18:27,807 --> 01:18:30,610
Don't get distracted!
We have to resist until the shooting point.

1227
01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:31,244


1228
01:18:32,045 --> 01:18:36,483


1229
01:18:36,483 --> 01:18:39,819
10 until reaching the optimal point for
the launch of the guided missiles.

1230
01:18:41,855 --> 01:18:42,989
We've entered orbit!

1231
01:18:42,989 --> 01:18:44,724
Launch all guided missiles!

1232
01:18:44,824 --> 01:18:47,027
Launch all guided missiles!

1233
01:19:04,077 --> 01:19:05,979


1234
01:19:09,449 --> 01:19:12,485
Recognised with optics
the final target, Unit 13!

1235
01:19:12,585 --> 01:19:16,289
As expected, before its restart.
Unit 13 is still not moving.

1236
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:23,196
Identified Eva Series 7 approaching,

1237
01:19:23,196 --> 01:19:25,932
in very high numbers, immeasurable.

1238
01:19:26,032 --> 01:19:28,902
Ignore the small fish!
Hurry the launch of both Evas.

1239
01:19:29,235 --> 01:19:31,104
Maya, prepare the launch of both Evas.

1240
01:19:31,404 --> 01:19:33,940
Understood, preparing launch of both Evas.

1241
01:19:33,940 --> 01:19:34,641
Launch!

1242
01:19:39,946 --> 01:19:42,015
Please, Mari, Asuka.

1243
01:19:53,727 --> 01:19:56,963


1244
01:19:59,866 --> 01:20:01,201


1245
01:20:05,405 --> 01:20:07,774
Ah! Get out of my way!

1246
01:20:07,774 --> 01:20:09,576


1247
01:20:17,784 --> 01:20:19,352


1248
01:20:19,352 --> 01:20:27,360


1249
01:20:27,827 --> 01:20:30,697
Here, sorry!

1250
01:20:30,697 --> 01:20:33,333


1251
01:20:33,833 --> 01:20:35,068


1252
01:20:35,669 --> 01:20:37,070


1253
01:20:38,938 --> 01:20:41,641


1254
01:20:41,741 --> 01:20:43,810
Four Eyes, next target!

1255
01:20:43,910 --> 01:20:44,744
Will do.

1256
01:20:48,481 --> 01:20:49,749


1257
01:20:50,350 --> 01:20:51,484


1258
01:20:54,621 --> 01:20:55,922


1259
01:20:56,690 --> 01:20:57,524
Next!

1260
01:20:57,624 --> 01:20:58,858


1261
01:20:58,858 --> 01:21:00,827


1262
01:21:01,695 --> 01:21:03,029


1263
01:21:03,229 --> 01:21:05,532


1264
01:21:09,336 --> 01:21:10,370


1265
01:21:12,038 --> 01:21:13,239
Princess!

1266
01:21:17,143 --> 01:21:19,112


1267
01:21:21,548 --> 01:21:22,582


1268
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:25,151


1269
01:21:26,586 --> 01:21:27,454


1270
01:21:28,488 --> 01:21:29,322


1271
01:21:29,422 --> 01:21:30,290
Nya-something!

1272
01:21:31,024 --> 01:21:31,891


1273
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:35,228


1274
01:21:35,562 --> 01:21:37,330


1275
01:21:44,270 --> 01:21:46,940
They're passing through just like the Eva.

1276
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:47,807
What a pain!

1277
01:21:47,907 --> 01:21:50,143


1278
01:21:50,410 --> 01:21:52,112


1279
01:21:54,414 --> 01:21:56,850
Four-eyes, give me a hand!

1280
01:21:56,850 --> 01:21:57,751
I know!

1281
01:22:07,727 --> 01:22:16,269


1282
01:22:16,269 --> 01:22:17,604


1283
01:22:20,874 --> 01:22:21,975


1284
01:22:21,975 --> 01:22:22,976


1285
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:29,416
Both Eva units have landed at Nerv's HQ.

1286
01:22:32,652 --> 01:22:34,821
The target is below that blast hole.

1287
01:22:34,921 --> 01:22:35,989


1288
01:22:41,027 --> 01:22:42,395


1289
01:22:48,501 --> 01:22:50,003


1290
01:22:50,870 --> 01:22:52,739


1291
01:22:56,443 --> 01:23:00,246
These things...
they're so incredibly annoying!

1292
01:23:00,714 --> 01:23:03,016


1293
01:23:04,517 --> 01:23:05,919


1294
01:23:06,953 --> 01:23:08,488


1295
01:23:08,488 --> 01:23:09,322


1296
01:23:09,422 --> 01:23:11,224
After you, Princess.

1297
01:23:11,324 --> 01:23:12,892
I'm sorry Four-Eyes!

1298
01:23:18,298 --> 01:23:22,035


1299
01:23:37,517 --> 01:23:39,319
Eva Unit 13.

1300
01:23:39,853 --> 01:23:40,854
Just in time.

1301
01:23:47,861 --> 01:23:50,063
Even if I spoke of god's machine,

1302
01:23:50,163 --> 01:23:55,435
after all Unit 13 is a man-made all-purpose
humanoid weapon made by man.

1303
01:23:57,370 --> 01:24:01,107
If we drive into the core
the forced termination signal plug,

1304
01:24:01,374 --> 01:24:04,544
even without being able to destroy it,
it won't be moving anymore.

1305
01:24:07,414 --> 01:24:08,348
With this...

1306
01:24:09,349 --> 01:24:11,017
It ends...

1307
01:24:12,085 --> 01:24:14,587


1308
01:24:17,290 --> 01:24:18,658
An A.T. Field?

1309
01:24:20,026 --> 01:24:23,196
But Unit 13 shouldn't
have an A.T. Field.

1310
01:24:23,296 --> 01:24:24,631
How?

1311
01:24:25,365 --> 01:24:28,501
This is the Eva's own A.T. Field!

1312
01:24:28,935 --> 01:24:31,738
New Unit 2 is
scared of Unit 13?

1313
01:24:33,940 --> 01:24:34,574


1314
01:24:35,608 --> 01:24:37,077


1315
01:24:38,445 --> 01:24:39,946


1316
01:24:40,046 --> 01:24:41,114


1317
01:24:41,614 --> 01:24:43,350


1318
01:24:45,151 --> 01:24:46,486
Something's not right...

1319
01:24:47,153 --> 01:24:48,955
Gendo,
what are you scheming?

1320
01:24:53,026 --> 01:24:56,696
This is weird,
Nerv's battleship is withdrawing.

1321
01:24:56,796 --> 01:24:58,398
It's descending.

1322
01:25:12,579 --> 01:25:15,181
The cursed Epicenter
of the Second Impact.

1323
01:25:15,181 --> 01:25:16,282
Calvary Base.

1324
01:25:17,684 --> 01:25:19,853
The portal of hell is open again...

1325
01:25:20,253 --> 01:25:20,954
What?

1326
01:25:26,026 --> 01:25:27,727
Wings of light?

1327
01:25:27,727 --> 01:25:31,698
Are you trying to cause the Fourth with
the same method as the Second Impact?

1328
01:25:31,798 --> 01:25:32,732
No.

1329
01:25:32,832 --> 01:25:36,536
The ships built as watchmen to Guf
shouldn't be able to be used as triggers.

1330
01:25:37,170 --> 01:25:40,373
Also, the event enclosing the Black Moon
differs from the plan.

1331
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:44,444
This is not in Seele's scenario.
It's a ritual we don't know.

1332
01:25:44,644 --> 01:25:48,081
Totally unexpected.
Is this Another Impact?

1333
01:25:50,183 --> 01:25:53,853
Whatever the conditions,
we'll completely destroy Nerv's plan!

1334
01:25:53,953 --> 01:25:57,190
Prepare the cannons!
Submerge ahead of the third ship!

1335
01:25:57,290 --> 01:26:00,193
Aim all possible cannons
to the third ship!

1336
01:26:00,293 --> 01:26:04,197


1337
01:26:04,197 --> 01:26:06,399
Start firing!

1338
01:26:06,399 --> 01:26:09,402
But in the building plan,
there's supposed to be even a fourth ship.

1339
01:26:09,402 --> 01:26:10,737
Attack!

1340
01:26:12,739 --> 01:26:14,307


1341
01:26:14,407 --> 01:26:15,275
What's the situation?

1342
01:26:15,375 --> 01:26:19,112
Direct hit! Both sides of
the 2nd hull were pierced!

1343
01:26:19,446 --> 01:26:21,848
Main battery tower down!

1344
01:26:30,223 --> 01:26:34,327
The fourth ship, Gebet!
We got into a trap.

1345
01:26:37,897 --> 01:26:41,201
For finishing the Impact,
this is essential.

1346
01:26:41,735 --> 01:26:44,671
So I have to destroy it now!

1347
01:26:46,006 --> 01:26:48,808
The prey is in front of me,
it's somewhat out of my control.

1348
01:26:49,876 --> 01:26:51,578
The last measure.

1349
01:26:51,778 --> 01:26:54,881
Sorry New Unit 02, once again
I'll be pushing you to the limit.

1350
01:26:55,615 --> 01:26:59,352
Releasing all limiters,
back-code 999.

1351
01:27:03,023 --> 01:27:04,224


1352
01:27:06,026 --> 01:27:08,895


1353
01:27:08,995 --> 01:27:10,030


1354
01:27:10,130 --> 01:27:14,234


1355
01:27:16,369 --> 01:27:17,337


1356
01:27:19,873 --> 01:27:23,043
Pattern blue! We have a response
to Angel 9 from within Nerv's HQ.

1357
01:27:23,877 --> 01:27:25,779


1358
01:27:25,879 --> 01:27:28,181
Princess! Are you going
to use the Angel's power?

1359
01:27:33,787 --> 01:27:37,023


1360
01:27:37,023 --> 01:27:39,793
Angel's Blood...

1361
01:27:40,527 --> 01:27:42,228
Total submersion!

1362
01:27:48,435 --> 01:27:51,604


1363
01:27:51,604 --> 01:27:54,307


1364
01:27:56,276 --> 01:28:02,248


1365
01:28:06,419 --> 01:28:08,922


1366
01:28:09,923 --> 01:28:11,291


1367
01:28:12,359 --> 01:28:15,395


1368
01:28:18,999 --> 01:28:20,400


1369
01:28:27,907 --> 01:28:29,876


1370
01:28:33,913 --> 01:28:36,316
Princess, do you plan on
discarding your humanity?

1371
01:28:46,726 --> 01:28:49,229
I'll neutralise New Unit 02's AT Field

1372
01:28:49,329 --> 01:28:52,432
with my own AT Field!

1373
01:28:58,538 --> 01:29:00,273


1374
01:29:00,273 --> 01:29:03,243


1375
01:29:08,415 --> 01:29:09,516


1376
01:29:09,516 --> 01:29:13,353


1377
01:29:13,687 --> 01:29:21,561


1378
01:29:31,538 --> 01:29:34,040
Wasn't it a Single Entry?

1379
01:29:44,584 --> 01:29:47,787
Damn it! Was Gendo's aim
the Princess' Angel transformation?

1380
01:29:49,189 --> 01:29:50,123


1381
01:29:50,523 --> 01:29:51,358


1382
01:29:51,458 --> 01:29:52,192


1383
01:29:55,628 --> 01:29:56,896


1384
01:29:56,896 --> 01:29:59,032


1385
01:29:59,032 --> 01:30:00,233


1386
01:30:00,233 --> 01:30:02,369


1387
01:30:02,369 --> 01:30:06,072
Shikinami type...
my original?

1388
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:09,409
Wahhhhh!

1389
01:30:11,745 --> 01:30:14,647
The last Eva, in the same form of a god.

1390
01:30:14,748 --> 01:30:17,784
You too will just
accept me with love.

1391
01:30:18,451 --> 01:30:20,420
Come, this way.

1392
01:30:21,621 --> 01:30:23,723


1393
01:30:23,823 --> 01:30:25,058
Sorry to bother you.

1394
01:30:25,058 --> 01:30:26,026
Huh.

1395
01:30:26,526 --> 01:30:27,794


1396
01:30:29,029 --> 01:30:30,030


1397
01:30:30,397 --> 01:30:32,098
It's useless,
you silly person.

1398
01:30:32,198 --> 01:30:32,832


1399
01:30:38,872 --> 01:30:39,539


1400
01:30:42,709 --> 01:30:44,077


1401
01:30:50,083 --> 01:30:52,752


1402
01:30:55,522 --> 01:30:56,523
Asuka!

1403
01:30:56,623 --> 01:31:00,060
We've lost all signals from New Unit 02!
Pilot's conditions unknown!

1404
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:02,729


1405
01:31:02,829 --> 01:31:04,898
We received serious damage by N2 Mine!

1406
01:31:04,898 --> 01:31:06,766
Damn! What is it this time?

1407
01:31:10,670 --> 01:31:13,573
It's something Eva-like,
it's clinging to us!

1408
01:31:17,077 --> 01:31:19,779
Pattern blue,
Eva Opfer type.

1409
01:31:19,779 --> 01:31:22,082
You built a new Mark 09,
pilot included?

1410
01:31:29,289 --> 01:31:32,892
This is bad! The inside of the ship
is being physically eroded.

1411
01:31:32,892 --> 01:31:33,893
Eliminate it, hurry!

1412
01:31:33,994 --> 01:31:35,195
I'm trying,

1413
01:31:35,195 --> 01:31:38,331
but the speed of infiltration
is too much, we can't make up for it!

1414
01:31:40,033 --> 01:31:42,502


1415
01:31:43,236 --> 01:31:45,572
Mark 09 is breaking through
the VD protective wall!

1416
01:31:45,572 --> 01:31:48,641
It's useless! Our controls
have been completely hijacked!

1417
01:31:48,641 --> 01:31:50,043


1418
01:31:52,045 --> 01:31:53,079


1419
01:32:01,121 --> 01:32:03,523
This thing is done for.

1420
01:32:03,523 --> 01:32:06,559
As expected, splendid work,
Fuyutsuki Vice Chief.

1421
01:32:21,374 --> 01:32:27,147
The reemergence of the artificial Lilith, as well as
the forced appropriation of the Spear of the Black Moon.

1422
01:32:27,881 --> 01:32:33,186
The stage is set. How will you
play the final scene to come, Ikari?

1423
01:32:35,922 --> 01:32:38,058
We've identified the intruder in the upper ship!

1424
01:32:40,527 --> 01:32:41,394
Commander Ikari!

1425
01:32:46,533 --> 01:32:48,268


1426
01:32:48,368 --> 01:32:52,238
I'm sorry Princess.
Truly the pinnacle of shame.

1427
01:32:53,306 --> 01:32:56,076
It seems we'll have to
back off for some time.

1428
01:32:56,976 --> 01:32:57,777
Yes.

1429
01:33:05,018 --> 01:33:06,586
It's been a long time.

1430
01:33:09,589 --> 01:33:11,024
Commander Ikari.

1431
01:33:13,193 --> 01:33:16,196
Thank you for your hard work so far,
Colonel Katsuragi.

1432
01:33:17,130 --> 01:33:20,266
We made use of
this ship as we planned.

1433
01:33:20,367 --> 01:33:21,501


1434
01:33:23,169 --> 01:33:24,504
You...

1435
01:33:25,205 --> 01:33:31,411
No point in arguing, it's the same as always.
No hesitation in accomplishing your goal.

1436
01:33:31,745 --> 01:33:33,980
Yes, it's something you taught me.

1437
01:33:33,980 --> 01:33:35,915


1438
01:33:41,321 --> 01:33:42,589


1439
01:33:47,060 --> 01:33:49,029
There are no barriers for a god.

1440
01:33:50,363 --> 01:33:53,099
You just have to accept
all that is coming.

1441
01:33:53,767 --> 01:33:55,268
Ikari Gendo.

1442
01:33:55,368 --> 01:33:59,039
Did you use the Key of Nebuchadnezzar
and throw away your humanity?

1443
01:33:59,406 --> 01:34:02,208
I have just added to my own body

1444
01:34:02,442 --> 01:34:06,913
the information that surpassed the logic
of this world. Without any problem.

1445
01:34:08,248 --> 01:34:09,983


1446
01:34:09,983 --> 01:34:10,817


1447
01:34:11,418 --> 01:34:15,689
I will kill God and will assemble
together Humankind and God,

1448
01:34:16,022 --> 01:34:21,061
holding the luxury of an Angel, I will accomplish
the evolution of Mankind and its complementation.

1449
01:34:21,494 --> 01:34:23,897
Is that the reason why
you used and discarded Asuka?

1450
01:34:23,997 --> 01:34:24,998
Ikari Gendo!

1451
01:34:25,332 --> 01:34:27,734
The Ayanami and
Shikinami Type Pilots,

1452
01:34:28,201 --> 01:34:31,104
were prepared from the start
for this very purpose.

1453
01:34:31,871 --> 01:34:33,373
Without any problem.

1454
01:35:02,535 --> 01:35:05,205
This is humankind's... no,

1455
01:35:05,905 --> 01:35:09,109
this is the commoditization of
the ancient life of this planet.

1456
01:35:09,209 --> 01:35:11,811
The transformation of every soul into Core,

1457
01:35:12,145 --> 01:35:14,280
being turned into Eva Infinity,

1458
01:35:14,381 --> 01:35:16,116
the beginning of the Fourth Impact?!

1459
01:35:19,352 --> 01:35:20,286
Exactly.

1460
01:35:20,854 --> 01:35:24,057
Purification of the Sea
by means of the Second Impact.

1461
01:35:24,057 --> 01:35:26,192
Purification of the Land
by means of the Third.

1462
01:35:26,860 --> 01:35:29,896
And then, Purification of Life
by the Fourth.

1463
01:35:29,996 --> 01:35:35,068
The materialization of the souls,
with Core shaped as the Eva Infinity.

1464
01:35:36,436 --> 01:35:38,938
To throw away the vessel
of the human species,

1465
01:35:39,272 --> 01:35:42,776
to invite to a stain-free heaven
of collective intelligence,

1466
01:35:43,076 --> 01:35:44,744
the final ritual.

1467
01:35:45,478 --> 01:35:47,781
Through the Second Impact,

1468
01:35:47,881 --> 01:35:53,753
your father, Dr. Katsuragi,
verified our hypotheses.

1469
01:35:54,087 --> 01:35:56,189
The Human Instrumentality Project.

1470
01:35:56,856 --> 01:35:59,893
I will for sure put a stop
to my father's nonsense.

1471
01:36:00,493 --> 01:36:05,732
For humanity, that has eaten the Fruit
of Knowledge, two fates were given by god.

1472
01:36:06,199 --> 01:36:09,769
To be destroyed by the Angels,
that have eaten the fruit of Life,

1473
01:36:09,769 --> 01:36:12,939
or to destroy the Angels
and steal their place,

1474
01:36:12,939 --> 01:36:17,811
to turn into children of god and continue
to live in eternity without knowledge.

1475
01:36:18,278 --> 01:36:21,114
We can only choose one or the other.

1476
01:36:21,581 --> 01:36:24,117
Nerv's Human Instrumentality Project,

1477
01:36:24,417 --> 01:36:27,987
Seele, which chose the latter,
made use of their Adams.

1478
01:36:28,188 --> 01:36:30,790
It is but a fleeting resistance to god.

1479
01:36:31,291 --> 01:36:33,526
It's worth the effort.

1480
01:36:34,227 --> 01:36:35,695
For us, who yielded to god,

1481
01:36:35,695 --> 01:36:39,366
following the Instrumentality Project,
there's no reset of despair,

1482
01:36:39,766 --> 01:36:41,935
we choose the continue of hope.

1483
01:36:41,935 --> 01:36:47,474
I believe in the will and the knowledge of humans,
who have surpassed even the power of god.

1484
01:36:48,041 --> 01:36:50,577
It's a difference in the way
we grasp the truth.

1485
01:36:51,077 --> 01:36:53,246
The world for Colonel Katsuragi,

1486
01:36:53,646 --> 01:36:56,783
and the shape of happiness for Akagi,
are unthinkable.

1487
01:36:57,317 --> 01:37:00,420
People's thoughts won't change a thing.

1488
01:37:02,088 --> 01:37:05,358
With this,
all the Horsemen have been gathered.

1489
01:37:07,293 --> 01:37:10,730


1490
01:37:14,401 --> 01:37:19,072
Then, I'll be taking back Eva Unit 01,
that you kept in custody.

1491
01:37:21,708 --> 01:37:22,542
Father!

1492
01:37:49,269 --> 01:37:53,239


1493
01:38:23,069 --> 01:38:24,204


1494
01:38:26,172 --> 01:38:28,074


1495
01:38:31,144 --> 01:38:33,313


1496
01:38:34,481 --> 01:38:36,583
We survived even the Near Third Impact.

1497
01:38:37,150 --> 01:38:41,254
Have trust in our own luck
and in Misato's Wille.

1498
01:38:44,658 --> 01:38:46,459
On the other side of the Doors of Guf,

1499
01:38:46,726 --> 01:38:49,162
the Minus Space that the Wunder
can't interfere with.

1500
01:38:49,896 --> 01:38:54,334
I'm sorry to say that for Wille there's
no way to stop the Instrumentality Project.

1501
01:38:55,268 --> 01:38:56,770
It's all over.

1502
01:38:58,038 --> 01:38:59,539
Misato.

1503
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:02,776
I'll get in Eva Unit 01.

1504
01:39:07,213 --> 01:39:09,115


1505
01:39:22,462 --> 01:39:24,998
The way back where Ayanami disappeared.

1506
01:39:25,398 --> 01:39:28,201
Kaji taught me.
I could smell the soil.

1507
01:39:31,104 --> 01:39:34,240
I'll accept half of
what Misato is carrying.

1508
01:39:35,075 --> 01:39:39,212
For this reason I have decided
I will fight you, Ikari Gendo.

1509
01:39:43,616 --> 01:39:46,252
I want to make things right.

1510
01:39:58,131 --> 01:40:01,434
Wait a second,
don't mess around!

1511
01:40:01,701 --> 01:40:04,170
You really plan to get into the Eva?

1512
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:09,209
I thought this could happen.

1513
01:40:10,043 --> 01:40:14,214
Captain, didn't we get authorization for unconditional
firing for this very situation?

1514
01:40:15,081 --> 01:40:18,785
Disease god! Because of the
Near Third Impact you brought about,

1515
01:40:18,952 --> 01:40:20,920
our lives have become so chaotic.

1516
01:40:21,187 --> 01:40:24,691
The main source of everything,
just you two, father and son...

1517
01:40:25,325 --> 01:40:27,227
I won't let it happen!

1518
01:40:30,296 --> 01:40:31,698


1519
01:40:32,532 --> 01:40:33,566
Sakura?

1520
01:40:33,566 --> 01:40:36,036
Ikari Shinji will not pilot the Eva.

1521
01:40:36,870 --> 01:40:40,240
Ikari getting into the Eva
brought unhappiness to everyone,

1522
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:42,776
and I was unhappy myself.

1523
01:40:42,776 --> 01:40:45,612
So Ikari will not pilot the Eva again.

1524
01:40:46,713 --> 01:40:48,581
No, Sakura.

1525
01:40:49,482 --> 01:40:51,151
Please let me get into the Eva.

1526
01:40:51,151 --> 01:40:53,853
Don't be absurd, Ikari.

1527
01:40:54,454 --> 01:40:56,823
If you're hurt,
you won't have to ride anymore.

1528
01:40:56,923 --> 01:40:59,859
But being hurt is preferable
to getting into the Eva,

1529
01:40:59,859 --> 01:41:01,361
so please endure this!

1530
01:41:01,461 --> 01:41:02,362


1531
01:41:02,462 --> 01:41:03,530


1532
01:41:04,197 --> 01:41:04,931
Misato!

1533
01:41:05,031 --> 01:41:06,599
Captain!

1534
01:41:07,033 --> 01:41:07,901
Misato!

1535
01:41:09,102 --> 01:41:10,870
It's alright, Shinji.

1536
01:41:11,771 --> 01:41:15,108
If you hadn't gotten into
Eva Unit 01 14 years ago,

1537
01:41:15,208 --> 01:41:17,911
at that time we would all
have been destroyed.

1538
01:41:18,545 --> 01:41:20,080
So thank you.

1539
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:23,850
Even if the result was caused
by the Near Third Impact,

1540
01:41:25,018 --> 01:41:28,455
the responsibility for the action
you, Shinji, have taken, is solely mine.

1541
01:41:28,922 --> 01:41:32,125
Even now, Ikari Shinji,
you are my subordinate.

1542
01:41:32,359 --> 01:41:34,194
The responsibility for his actions
from now on,

1543
01:41:34,194 --> 01:41:35,962
will be mine alone.

1544
01:41:37,864 --> 01:41:41,768
I leave everything to you now, Shinji.

1545
01:41:45,205 --> 01:41:50,410
Sure!
Ikari is the benefactor who saved us,

1546
01:41:50,810 --> 01:41:54,080
but our father also disappeared
with the Near Third Impact.

1547
01:41:54,681 --> 01:41:57,650
Ikari is a benefactor and an enemy!

1548
01:41:57,751 --> 01:42:00,020
It's the only way!

1549
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:01,588


1550
01:42:02,622 --> 01:42:05,458
That's enough!
Enough, Sakura.

1551
01:42:06,693 --> 01:42:09,496
Let's just think of living to see tomorrow.

1552
01:42:09,696 --> 01:42:12,499
Oh my god...

1553
01:42:20,206 --> 01:42:22,275
Sorry!

1554
01:42:24,377 --> 01:42:26,613
The preparations took a while.

1555
01:42:26,713 --> 01:42:27,714
Now, let's go!

1556
01:42:28,181 --> 01:42:29,182
Puppy Boy.

1557
01:42:31,651 --> 01:42:34,654
Maya, get the plugsuit
that's kept in the Captain's room.

1558
01:42:37,791 --> 01:42:41,795
I'll apply first aid now,
the bullet will melt immediately.

1559
01:42:42,195 --> 01:42:43,963
It's fine, Second Lieutenant.

1560
01:42:45,865 --> 01:42:47,167
Ikari Shinji.

1561
01:42:48,335 --> 01:42:51,237
The only things a son can do to his father

1562
01:42:51,604 --> 01:42:55,075
are giving him a pat on his shoulder,
or killing him.

1563
01:42:55,775 --> 01:42:56,976
It's just what Kaji told me.

1564
01:42:58,211 --> 01:43:01,247
Misato,
I have met Kaji Ryoji.

1565
01:43:02,082 --> 01:43:03,350
Is he well?

1566
01:43:03,450 --> 01:43:04,417
Yes.

1567
01:43:05,018 --> 01:43:06,853
I'm glad.

1568
01:43:07,921 --> 01:43:09,689
He was a very nice man.

1569
01:43:10,123 --> 01:43:13,326
Though I have spoken with him
only briefly, I like him.

1570
01:43:14,027 --> 01:43:15,528
Thank you.

1571
01:43:18,064 --> 01:43:22,435
Shinji, please always
be there for him.

1572
01:43:23,670 --> 01:43:24,904
I will.

1573
01:43:26,172 --> 01:43:28,475
Misato,
I'm off.

1574
01:43:28,575 --> 01:43:29,876
Take care.

1575
01:43:49,295 --> 01:43:51,064
Well, let's go back to the job.

1576
01:43:51,064 --> 01:43:54,401
The ship's worn out,
the main and support ships are still lost.

1577
01:43:54,501 --> 01:43:56,436
It will be a miracle
if we can just stay afloat.

1578
01:43:56,536 --> 01:43:57,771
That's fine.

1579
01:43:58,338 --> 01:44:01,941
Before we run out of reserve power,
an even greater miracle will occur.

1580
01:44:02,976 --> 01:44:05,445
With the Revised 8
in Overlap-compatibility form,

1581
01:44:05,545 --> 01:44:06,813
I'll capture the Adams Vessels,

1582
01:44:06,913 --> 01:44:08,982
thanks to the "plus four-in-one" status.

1583
01:44:09,082 --> 01:44:13,653
I'm thankful I can proceed easily
even in this Minus Space, nya.

1584
01:44:14,688 --> 01:44:17,390
Well then, Puppy Boy,
what you have to do,

1585
01:44:17,490 --> 01:44:21,561
before the Anti-L System stops completely
and everyone turns to Core,

1586
01:44:21,661 --> 01:44:25,231
is to destroy Unit 13.
We need to plan for its revival.

1587
01:44:25,865 --> 01:44:27,500
Alright, got it.

1588
01:44:27,934 --> 01:44:30,437
But of course,
Gendo will be

1589
01:44:30,537 --> 01:44:33,973
repeatedly quantum-teleporting,
taking advantage of the Minus Space.

1590
01:44:34,374 --> 01:44:37,110
So even catching him
will not be easy at all, nya.

1591
01:44:37,210 --> 01:44:40,780
It will be fine Mari.
I'm off!

1592
01:44:40,780 --> 01:44:42,082
Oh,

1593
01:44:42,282 --> 01:44:47,787
Puppy Boy, there's a possibility that the
soul of the Princess is inside Unit 13.

1594
01:44:48,321 --> 01:44:50,623
So please, the Princess...
save Asuka!

1595
01:44:51,558 --> 01:44:52,525
I'll try.

1596
01:44:54,160 --> 01:44:55,395
Ayanami.

1597
01:45:02,435 --> 01:45:05,105
Wherever you are,
I'll always come and meet you.

1598
01:45:05,672 --> 01:45:09,042
So please wait for me,
Shinji.

1599
01:45:09,642 --> 01:45:11,644
I will, thank you.

1600
01:45:12,479 --> 01:45:13,780
I'll be waiting.

1601
01:45:17,650 --> 01:45:18,651
Good Luck.

1602
01:45:19,619 --> 01:45:21,521
Are you done? Rei.

1603
01:45:22,789 --> 01:45:24,224
Ayanami.

1604
01:45:25,025 --> 01:45:28,061
Ikari, I'm sorry.

1605
01:45:28,495 --> 01:45:32,599
I wasn't able to make it so
you didn't have to pilot the Eva, Ikari.

1606
01:45:32,699 --> 01:45:35,735
It's alright.
Thank you, Ayanami.

1607
01:45:36,436 --> 01:45:38,238
I'll take care of the rest.

1608
01:45:38,338 --> 01:45:40,073
Yes, please.

1609
01:45:45,412 --> 01:45:46,646


1610
01:45:46,646 --> 01:45:49,849
<Has the Pilot of Unit 01 awoken?>

1611
01:45:49,849 --> 01:45:52,819
We've received a signal from
the Minus Space via Revised 8!

1612
01:45:52,919 --> 01:45:54,654
Eva Unit 01 restart!

1613
01:45:54,654 --> 01:45:56,323
That's impossible!

1614
01:45:56,423 --> 01:45:59,225
Despite the disease god's
synch-rate being zero...

1615
01:45:59,326 --> 01:46:02,562
Could it be?
Shinji's true synch-rate is not zero,

1616
01:46:03,296 --> 01:46:04,931
but zero is the closest number to it?

1617
01:46:05,031 --> 01:46:08,234
Confirmed.
Synch-rate is Infinity.

1618
01:46:21,114 --> 01:46:24,918
Oh, has it changed into
the Spear of Hope, Cassius?

1619
01:46:28,922 --> 01:46:30,857
Stop, father!

1620
01:46:30,857 --> 01:46:32,058
Ah.

1621
01:46:32,158 --> 01:46:33,526
It's useless.

1622
01:46:33,526 --> 01:46:37,364
There's something... I have to do myself!

1623
01:46:37,464 --> 01:46:38,732


1624
01:46:46,873 --> 01:46:49,576
Until Another Impact is forced to happen,

1625
01:46:49,709 --> 01:46:51,444
what does that man intend to do?

1626
01:46:51,544 --> 01:46:54,748
As an objective of Another Impact,
there's only one thing I can think of.

1627
01:46:55,181 --> 01:46:57,017
The creation of a Spear
made for the Fourth.

1628
01:46:57,117 --> 01:47:00,186
The two Spears were preserved until
the end for the sake of the Additional.

1629
01:47:00,687 --> 01:47:03,556
I'm afraid that it was done
for that one single desire.

1630
01:47:04,190 --> 01:47:06,626
Absurd, it's just his ego.

1631
01:47:08,828 --> 01:47:11,364
We'll soon be able to meet again, Yui.

1632
01:47:11,364 --> 01:47:13,500
Don't move.

1633
01:47:13,933 --> 01:47:15,735
Get away from it, father!

1634
01:47:15,735 --> 01:47:16,903


1635
01:47:19,939 --> 01:47:21,141
What is that?

1636
01:47:21,141 --> 01:47:22,909
The Golgotha Object.

1637
01:47:23,276 --> 01:47:25,445
Someone that is not a human,

1638
01:47:25,612 --> 01:47:30,417
has left here the world of god
together with the Adams and the 6 Spears.

1639
01:47:30,917 --> 01:47:34,788
My wife... your mother was also here.

1640
01:47:35,255 --> 01:47:38,158
The beginning of everything,
the Promised Land.

1641
01:47:38,625 --> 01:47:41,061
It's the one and only place where one can

1642
01:47:41,394 --> 01:47:45,198
change their destiny,
that is otherwise out of human's control.

1643
01:47:45,999 --> 01:47:47,067


1644
01:47:52,372 --> 01:47:53,373
Here?

1645
01:47:55,041 --> 01:47:56,443
The Eva Cage?

1646
01:47:57,811 --> 01:47:58,945
What is this place?

1647
01:47:59,045 --> 01:48:01,648
It's the world of your memories.

1648
01:48:01,648 --> 01:48:02,682
Father.

1649
01:48:03,083 --> 01:48:07,187
We can't understand the Minus Space
with our sensory functions.

1650
01:48:07,620 --> 01:48:12,692
Therefore, the LCL molds it into
a virtual world we can perceive.

1651
01:48:13,393 --> 01:48:15,562
Just give me Unit 01.

1652
01:48:16,029 --> 01:48:19,899
If you do so, you too
will be able to meet your mother again.

1653
01:48:21,735 --> 01:48:23,236


1654
01:48:25,071 --> 01:48:26,239


1655
01:48:30,110 --> 01:48:35,115
This is why I don't like children,
opposing a futile resistance.

1656
01:48:35,115 --> 01:48:38,351


1657
01:48:49,696 --> 01:48:52,932
We'll have to take a detour.

1658
01:49:07,881 --> 01:49:08,915


1659
01:49:15,021 --> 01:49:15,989


1660
01:49:18,058 --> 01:49:19,192


1661
01:49:24,698 --> 01:49:25,899


1662
01:49:26,433 --> 01:49:27,734


1663
01:49:32,539 --> 01:49:33,707


1664
01:49:39,713 --> 01:49:40,914


1665
01:49:43,183 --> 01:49:44,150


1666
01:49:46,686 --> 01:49:48,355


1667
01:49:50,357 --> 01:49:51,491


1668
01:49:55,528 --> 01:49:56,796


1669
01:50:02,035 --> 01:50:03,403


1670
01:50:04,871 --> 01:50:05,605


1671
01:50:09,542 --> 01:50:10,577


1672
01:50:15,515 --> 01:50:16,616


1673
01:50:22,422 --> 01:50:23,857


1674
01:50:27,994 --> 01:50:28,862


1675
01:50:32,699 --> 01:50:33,900


1676
01:50:37,537 --> 01:50:38,338


1677
01:50:39,205 --> 01:50:40,106


1678
01:50:41,207 --> 01:50:43,877
What's this? It moves the same way I do.

1679
01:50:45,211 --> 01:50:46,646
It's not easy!

1680
01:50:46,746 --> 01:50:48,648
Eva Unit 13.

1681
01:50:48,748 --> 01:50:52,752
The machine of despair,
counterpart of the Unit 01 of hope.

1682
01:50:53,153 --> 01:50:56,523
They conform to one another,
they get in tune.

1683
01:50:56,623 --> 01:50:59,392
This too is a necessary ritual.

1684
01:51:00,393 --> 01:51:02,228
Stop it already, father!

1685
01:51:02,228 --> 01:51:03,163


1686
01:51:05,732 --> 01:51:06,933
It's pointless.

1687
01:51:06,933 --> 01:51:11,404
With so little strength,
there's no way you can stop me!

1688
01:51:11,504 --> 01:51:12,672


1689
01:51:30,023 --> 01:51:31,691


1690
01:51:31,691 --> 01:51:33,126


1691
01:51:36,196 --> 01:51:37,897
Do you still not understand?

1692
01:51:37,998 --> 01:51:38,865


1693
01:51:42,168 --> 01:51:43,069


1694
01:51:44,170 --> 01:51:45,338


1695
01:51:47,307 --> 01:51:48,475


1696
01:51:48,475 --> 01:51:50,777
Even with strength, you're no match.

1697
01:51:55,048 --> 01:51:57,517
Not to mention violence and fear.

1698
01:51:57,617 --> 01:52:01,254
Because that's not the way
we settle things!

1699
01:52:03,890 --> 01:52:05,525


1700
01:52:24,377 --> 01:52:28,481
That's right.
This won't be settled with strength.

1701
01:52:28,481 --> 01:52:29,916
Right.

1702
01:52:30,917 --> 01:52:32,952
I want to talk with you, father.

1703
01:52:34,754 --> 01:52:38,658
Father.
What do you want to do here?

1704
01:52:39,159 --> 01:52:42,395
It can happen only by using
this Golgotha Object.

1705
01:52:42,395 --> 01:52:44,164
The Additional Impact.

1706
01:52:44,831 --> 01:52:48,601
That will lead to
the path of my deicide.

1707
01:52:49,502 --> 01:52:54,107
That is why the last two Spears
have been brought here.

1708
01:52:55,075 --> 01:52:57,811
As we thought,
Magi Copy is predicting

1709
01:52:57,811 --> 01:53:01,648
a high probability Commander Ikari will
use and then dispose of the two Spears.

1710
01:53:01,648 --> 01:53:03,683
If we lose all the spears,

1711
01:53:03,683 --> 01:53:06,453
won't Shinji also lose the means
to stop the activation?

1712
01:53:06,619 --> 01:53:07,854
What should we do?

1713
01:53:07,954 --> 01:53:11,858
We'll make new Spears ourselves
and take them to where he is.

1714
01:53:11,858 --> 01:53:14,894
What are going to do
if we can't do that?

1715
01:53:14,995 --> 01:53:17,530
When the ship was taken over as the Buße,

1716
01:53:17,630 --> 01:53:21,901
it used materials from the Black Moon
to create an unknown Spear.

1717
01:53:22,335 --> 01:53:26,506
So, using this ship, we should be able
to make new Spears ourselves.

1718
01:53:26,973 --> 01:53:28,641
Putting humanity's will into the Wunder,

1719
01:53:28,775 --> 01:53:30,443
an even bigger miracle is possible.

1720
01:53:30,443 --> 01:53:33,613
I trust in Ritsuko's knowledge,
and in Wille and Wunder's

1721
01:53:34,147 --> 01:53:35,648
mysterious power.

1722
01:53:35,648 --> 01:53:37,083
Don't be absurd.

1723
01:53:37,450 --> 01:53:39,919
The only sample I have
is the activation data from earlier.

1724
01:53:40,086 --> 01:53:41,488
For you, that's more than enough.

1725
01:53:43,356 --> 01:53:45,492
Right, I'll try.

1726
01:53:46,126 --> 01:53:48,461
What we need is likely
in the spinal cord coupled system.

1727
01:53:48,962 --> 01:53:51,731
Sorry Maya, we're going to do this
without any preparation.

1728
01:53:51,831 --> 01:53:55,602
That's no problem, Vice Chief.
It's what we always do.

1729
01:53:57,037 --> 01:54:01,474
Chief engineer! The reserve power and
the spinal cord coupled system are safe.

1730
01:54:01,474 --> 01:54:04,277
Let's finish the rearrangement
work directly.

1731
01:54:04,744 --> 01:54:09,315
It won't do! You evacuate,
even just remaining here is dangerous!

1732
01:54:09,416 --> 01:54:10,984
It's the last public service.

1733
01:54:11,084 --> 01:54:12,619
We'll do all we can!

1734
01:54:13,853 --> 01:54:16,556
This is what young men are for.

1735
01:54:16,556 --> 01:54:21,561
Then, before Commander Ikari does
anything, we'll support Shinji.

1736
01:54:21,561 --> 01:54:22,696
Yes sir!

1737
01:54:22,796 --> 01:54:27,067
Unit 01's Pilot,
there's something I want to show you.

1738
01:54:31,538 --> 01:54:34,607
This is... a Black Lilith?

1739
01:54:34,708 --> 01:54:37,444
That's the way it is in your memory.

1740
01:54:37,877 --> 01:54:40,113
The Imaginary Evangelion,

1741
01:54:40,246 --> 01:54:42,015
predicted by Dr. Katsuragi,

1742
01:54:42,015 --> 01:54:46,353
a fictitious, imaginary Eva that shouldn't
exist in this world.

1743
01:54:46,753 --> 01:54:52,292
You can recognise that only human beings
believe in the equality of fiction and reality.

1744
01:54:55,328 --> 01:54:59,933
The Spears of Hope and Despair
become together trigger and luxury.

1745
01:55:00,033 --> 01:55:05,405
Fiction and reality melt together, and
everything becomes the same information.

1746
01:55:08,041 --> 01:55:10,910


1747
01:55:10,910 --> 01:55:14,080
This is my perception. In other words,

1748
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:14,147


1749
01:55:14,147 --> 01:55:17,851
the beginning of an Additional Impact
to rewrite the world.

1750
01:55:17,851 --> 01:55:27,560


1751
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:31,664
The only way to realise my desire.

1752
01:55:31,664 --> 01:55:53,853


1753
01:55:53,853 --> 01:55:56,423
Is this the Additional Impact?

1754
01:55:56,423 --> 01:55:56,856


1755
01:55:56,856 --> 01:56:00,660
Yes, that is possibly
the Imaginary Evangelion.

1756
01:56:00,660 --> 01:56:01,061


1757
01:56:01,061 --> 01:56:02,562
To think it actually exists.

1758
01:56:02,562 --> 01:56:03,029


1759
01:56:03,029 --> 01:56:04,064
This is weird.

1760
01:56:04,064 --> 01:56:08,568


1761
01:56:08,568 --> 01:56:09,869
Definitely weird!

1762
01:56:09,869 --> 01:56:09,936


1763
01:56:09,936 --> 01:56:13,940


1764
01:56:13,940 --> 01:56:57,017


1765
01:56:57,017 --> 01:56:59,986
Hmmm. Finally, it has begun.

1766
01:56:59,986 --> 01:57:02,022


1767
01:57:02,022 --> 01:57:02,922
You?

1768
01:57:02,922 --> 01:57:03,490


1769
01:57:03,490 --> 01:57:06,226
It's been a while, Professor Fuyutsuki.

1770
01:57:06,226 --> 01:57:06,826


1771
01:57:06,826 --> 01:57:11,331
By the way, isn't the L-Barrier density
too high in this ship?

1772
01:57:11,331 --> 01:57:11,698


1773
01:57:11,698 --> 01:57:14,934
Yes, it wasn't originally
meant to be manned.

1774
01:57:14,934 --> 01:57:15,335


1775
01:57:15,335 --> 01:57:16,569
I recognise it's impossible.

1776
01:57:16,569 --> 01:57:17,370


1777
01:57:17,370 --> 01:57:21,374
People are always given
a light called "hope".

1778
01:57:21,374 --> 01:57:21,708


1779
01:57:21,708 --> 01:57:26,613
But it's the nature of humanity
to cling to the sickness of hope and drown.

1780
01:57:26,613 --> 01:57:26,713


1781
01:57:26,713 --> 01:57:30,850
Both me and Ikari have been
clinging too much to the sickness of hope.

1782
01:57:30,850 --> 01:57:31,351


1783
01:57:31,351 --> 01:57:34,988
Gendo intends to make his desire
come true by making himself

1784
01:57:34,988 --> 01:57:35,088


1785
01:57:35,088 --> 01:57:36,990
the Center of Instrumentality.

1786
01:57:36,990 --> 01:57:37,557


1787
01:57:37,557 --> 01:57:39,626
I want to help with that... no.

1788
01:57:39,626 --> 01:57:40,193


1789
01:57:40,193 --> 01:57:43,730
Though I understand your feelings of
repeating your wishes, Fuyutsuki,

1790
01:57:43,730 --> 01:57:44,230


1791
01:57:44,230 --> 01:57:48,401
I don't want
all of humanity to be involved, nya.

1792
01:57:48,401 --> 01:57:48,902


1793
01:57:48,902 --> 01:57:52,005
I guess,
my role is over.

1794
01:57:52,005 --> 01:57:52,505


1795
01:57:52,505 --> 01:57:56,242
I have gathered what you wanted,
the rest is up to you.

1796
01:57:56,242 --> 01:57:56,876


1797
01:57:56,876 --> 01:57:59,079
Maria Iscariot.

1798
01:57:59,079 --> 01:57:59,145


1799
01:57:59,145 --> 01:58:03,850
Hah... I haven't heard that name
in a very long time.

1800
01:58:03,850 --> 01:58:04,918


1801
01:58:04,918 --> 01:58:07,754
Then, this is farewell.

1802
01:58:07,754 --> 01:58:15,962


1803
01:58:15,962 --> 01:58:19,399
Yui, is this good?

1804
01:58:19,399 --> 01:58:37,183


1805
01:58:37,183 --> 01:58:40,620


1806
01:58:53,333 --> 01:58:55,602
It moved, this can work!

1807
01:58:55,735 --> 01:58:58,505
Captain, for what's next,
the crew we have here is enough.

1808
01:58:59,105 --> 01:59:01,441
Understood,
all personnel, leave the ship.

1809
01:59:01,441 --> 01:59:03,109


1810
01:59:03,443 --> 01:59:06,446
All personnel, evacuate!
I repeat, all personnel, evacuate!

1811
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:10,016
Hurry to the escape capsules!

1812
01:59:10,016 --> 01:59:14,788


1813
01:59:14,788 --> 01:59:16,189
There's a whole bunch of Eva Opfer-type,

1814
01:59:16,189 --> 01:59:16,289


1815
01:59:16,289 --> 01:59:18,692
in the capacity of the Adams Vessels.

1816
01:59:18,692 --> 01:59:20,026


1817
01:59:20,026 --> 01:59:24,297
As one would expect, Professor Fuyutsuki's
performance was good, nya.

1818
01:59:24,297 --> 01:59:25,398


1819
01:59:25,398 --> 01:59:29,235
I'm sorry, you'll have to become

1820
01:59:29,235 --> 01:59:33,707


1821
01:59:33,707 --> 01:59:35,375
the nourishment for the Overlap!

1822
01:59:35,375 --> 01:59:36,042


1823
01:59:36,042 --> 01:59:37,077


1824
01:59:37,077 --> 01:59:40,780


1825
01:59:40,780 --> 01:59:43,350
With this, 8 + 9 + 10!

1826
01:59:43,350 --> 01:59:45,919


1827
01:59:45,919 --> 01:59:47,020


1828
01:59:47,020 --> 01:59:48,288


1829
01:59:48,288 --> 01:59:50,724


1830
01:59:50,724 --> 01:59:55,862


1831
01:59:55,862 --> 01:59:57,697
Plus 11!

1832
01:59:57,697 --> 02:00:05,839


1833
02:00:05,839 --> 02:00:09,576
Let's go for the last one!

1834
02:00:09,576 --> 02:00:09,576


1835
02:00:10,076 --> 02:00:12,312
Closure of escape capsules up to number 4.

1836
02:00:12,412 --> 02:00:15,281
Please hurry to capsule number 5!

1837
02:00:17,951 --> 02:00:20,120
I have returned to the cockpit.

1838
02:00:20,453 --> 02:00:22,822
Now, surviving is our job.

1839
02:00:23,990 --> 02:00:25,458
However tough it gets.

1840
02:00:31,498 --> 02:00:35,902
Captain, the rearrangement work is done.
I think we're good to go.

1841
02:00:36,236 --> 02:00:37,270
Understood.

1842
02:00:37,370 --> 02:00:41,975
Bring all control systems to
the Captain's seat, then leave the ship.

1843
02:00:41,975 --> 02:00:42,909
Misato?

1844
02:00:43,309 --> 02:00:46,813
Someone has to make sure
this operation proceeds.

1845
02:00:46,813 --> 02:00:49,783
And the person responsible for this ship
is me.

1846
02:00:50,750 --> 02:00:55,455
Take care of the children and
the life that remains, Ritsuko.

1847
02:00:57,691 --> 02:01:01,328
I understand, Misato.
I'll do my best.

1848
02:01:02,896 --> 02:01:03,697
Thank you.

1849
02:01:25,185 --> 02:01:27,687
Only a bit of reserve power left,

1850
02:01:27,787 --> 02:01:31,558
the last thing you want to rely on,
the old...

1851
02:01:33,326 --> 02:01:35,328
reaction-propulsion engine.

1852
02:01:54,481 --> 02:01:56,750


1853
02:02:07,694 --> 02:02:10,230
The Lilin won't have a use
for you guys anymore.

1854
02:02:10,797 --> 02:02:13,099
Sleep well,
Adams.

1855
02:02:14,167 --> 02:02:17,437
The Wunder has moved.
Let's hurry to the meet up, nya.

1856
02:02:18,038 --> 02:02:21,775
To think that the complementation of both
the physical and mental aspects of humanity

1857
02:02:21,875 --> 02:02:25,045
was activated at the same time.

1858
02:02:25,578 --> 02:02:28,248
Gendo, you are...

1859
02:02:28,782 --> 02:02:31,317
Father, what do you wish for?

1860
02:02:31,418 --> 02:02:35,689
The disappearance of the AT Field
you didn't choose yourself,

1861
02:02:36,189 --> 02:02:40,126
a single world of mind,
with the whole of humanity being equal.

1862
02:02:40,627 --> 02:02:42,395
Without differences between people.

1863
02:02:42,796 --> 02:02:47,434
Without rich and poor, discrimination,
conflict, abuse, pain, sadness.

1864
02:02:47,734 --> 02:02:50,236
A world of purely cleansed souls.

1865
02:02:50,704 --> 02:02:55,909
And then I will meet with Yui again.
A peaceful world.

1866
02:02:56,543 --> 02:03:00,747
<Yui, Yui, Yui, Yui!>

1867
02:03:01,214 --> 02:03:04,150
<Yui! Yui, where are you?>

1868
02:03:04,250 --> 02:03:05,418
<Where are you, Yui?!>

1869
02:03:06,286 --> 02:03:08,655
<Is everything here, just Rei?>

1870
02:03:08,655 --> 02:03:11,524
<Where? Where is she! Yui!>

1871
02:03:12,459 --> 02:03:15,362
Father, stop already.

1872
02:03:15,862 --> 02:03:18,865
Why.
Why are you here, Shinji?

1873
02:03:19,532 --> 02:03:21,434
Because I want to
let you know something.

1874
02:03:22,435 --> 02:03:26,873
Even when I was lonely,
I never tried to get closer to you.

1875
02:03:27,707 --> 02:03:31,311
I was afraid you would realise
that you hated me.

1876
02:03:32,379 --> 02:03:36,282
But now, I want to know
about you, father.

1877
02:03:40,754 --> 02:03:45,025
The A.T. Field,
did you abandon humanity for me?

1878
02:03:47,394 --> 02:03:50,363
Were you actually afraid of me?

1879
02:03:50,897 --> 02:03:52,732
Of me...

1880
02:03:52,832 --> 02:04:00,206
I wasn't supposed to throw this away,
but to give it to you, father.

1881
02:04:06,780 --> 02:04:09,249
We're the same.

1882
02:04:09,816 --> 02:04:11,785
Yes, you're right.

1883
02:04:12,185 --> 02:04:15,689
The headphones cut me off
from the outside world.

1884
02:04:16,623 --> 02:04:18,191
A cover of indifference.

1885
02:04:18,291 --> 02:04:21,528
It protected me
from the noise of others.

1886
02:04:21,661 --> 02:04:22,696


1887
02:04:23,163 --> 02:04:27,934
<But, after meeting Yui,
it became unnecessary.>

1888
02:04:28,034 --> 02:04:29,102


1889
02:04:29,536 --> 02:04:31,771
Have you chosen the name?

1890
02:04:31,771 --> 02:04:35,275
If it's a boy, "Shinji",
if it's a girl, "Rei".

1891
02:04:35,909 --> 02:04:40,146
Shinji. Rei.

1892
02:04:40,447 --> 02:04:45,285


1893
02:04:45,652 --> 02:04:46,486


1894
02:04:47,253 --> 02:04:50,223
<Not knowing the love of a parent,
I will become a father.>

1895
02:04:50,690 --> 02:04:55,228
<Of course, this world is
unstable, imperfect, irrational.>

1896
02:04:55,328 --> 02:04:59,566
<In this world, even taking others
by their word won't go well.>

1897
02:04:59,666 --> 02:05:02,602
<At different times,
people say different things.>

1898
02:05:03,737 --> 02:05:05,438
<I don't know>

1899
02:05:05,538 --> 02:05:07,874
<which is the truth,
which to go along with.>

1900
02:05:08,041 --> 02:05:11,244
<Maybe, both can be true
for that person.>

1901
02:05:11,611 --> 02:05:13,713
<It was just a change
in their feelings of the time.>

1902
02:05:14,581 --> 02:05:17,484
<I was afraid of connections to people.>

1903
02:05:18,118 --> 02:05:20,086
<I hated the world
overflowing with people.>

1904
02:05:20,820 --> 02:05:23,356
<Since I was a child,
solitude was ordinary.>

1905
02:05:23,456 --> 02:05:26,026
<And so I never experienced loneliness.>

1906
02:05:26,659 --> 02:05:30,397
<But in the world, there are
people who don't deem it acceptable.>

1907
02:05:31,131 --> 02:05:33,433
<I didn't like going to
other people's houses.>

1908
02:05:33,433 --> 02:05:37,270
<I despised being taken along to the houses
of uninteresting classmates and relatives, >

1909
02:05:37,370 --> 02:05:41,975
<and being imposed on the information and
fulfillment of that lifestyle.>

1910
02:05:42,776 --> 02:05:45,145
<Being with others was painful.>

1911
02:05:45,245 --> 02:05:47,647
<I wanted to be alone constantly.>

1912
02:05:48,648 --> 02:05:52,152
<Since I was a child,
there have been two things I liked.>

1913
02:05:52,252 --> 02:05:54,020
<One is knowledge.>

1914
02:05:54,020 --> 02:05:58,892
<Knowledge obtained unilaterally
sated the hunger of my mind.>

1915
02:05:59,125 --> 02:06:02,862
<Concerns are not needed for knowledge.
As long as there was time, >

1916
02:06:03,196 --> 02:06:06,399
<I could think as much as I wanted.>

1917
02:06:07,100 --> 02:06:09,069
<The other thing is the piano.>

1918
02:06:09,069 --> 02:06:13,373
<A tuned sound returns
the correct note of the keys.>

1919
02:06:15,709 --> 02:06:19,245
<In that, there's no lie.
There's no betrayal, no disappointment.>

1920
02:06:19,612 --> 02:06:23,316
<Silently, I was changed
by the flow of music.>

1921
02:06:23,316 --> 02:06:27,253
<I liked that system.
I liked being alone.>

1922
02:06:27,821 --> 02:06:32,726
<Neither I nor other people nor anyone
being hurt. Being alone was peaceful.>

1923
02:06:34,661 --> 02:06:36,529
<But I met Yui, >

1924
02:06:36,629 --> 02:06:40,900
< and I learned to enjoy living.>

1925
02:06:41,334 --> 02:06:45,572
<Only Yui accepted me as I was.>

1926
02:06:48,875 --> 02:06:51,811
<When I lost her, I...>

1927
02:06:52,112 --> 02:06:55,081
<I had lost my confidence
in living alone.>

1928
02:06:56,182 --> 02:06:58,752
<For the first time I knew
the suffering of solitude.>

1929
02:07:00,520 --> 02:07:03,790
<I couldn't bear losing her.>

1930
02:07:05,325 --> 02:07:08,662
<I merely wanted to cry on her chest.>

1931
02:07:09,829 --> 02:07:14,267
<I merely wanted to change myself
by being close to her.>

1932
02:07:15,502 --> 02:07:19,172
<I merely wanted to fulfill that desire.>

1933
02:07:20,306 --> 02:07:26,246
Due to my weakness,
I can't meet Yui.

1934
02:07:27,580 --> 02:07:29,082
Shinji...

1935
02:07:29,849 --> 02:07:32,485
I think it's because you
wouldn't recognise that weakness.

1936
02:07:34,754 --> 02:07:37,991
Did you know all along?
Father.

1937
02:07:38,358 --> 02:07:40,493


1938
02:07:41,194 --> 02:07:42,028
What is it?

1939
02:07:42,128 --> 02:07:44,331
It's certainly Misato.

1940
02:07:45,298 --> 02:07:47,267


1941
02:07:56,710 --> 02:07:57,977


1942
02:07:57,977 --> 02:07:59,412
Still more!

1943
02:08:08,755 --> 02:08:09,622
Ugh!

1944
02:08:20,700 --> 02:08:24,904
What... the "Holy Spear"
is completely lost.

1945
02:08:25,505 --> 02:08:28,975
The new Spear to rewrite the world
is supposed to be impossible.

1946
02:08:28,975 --> 02:08:31,778
The Spears given by god,
Cassius, the Spear of Hope,

1947
02:08:31,778 --> 02:08:33,413
and Longinus, the Spear of Despair,

1948
02:08:33,880 --> 02:08:37,150
even if we lose them, we'll have Gaius,
the Spear newly made with

1949
02:08:37,250 --> 02:08:40,320
with the power of our determination
to return the world the way it was.

1950
02:08:40,854 --> 02:08:42,689
Or better, Wille's Spear.

1951
02:08:43,523 --> 02:08:47,360
Humanity, that holds knowledge and determination,
without any help from god,

1952
02:08:47,560 --> 02:08:49,896
has come this far, Yui.

1953
02:09:05,478 --> 02:09:06,646
I've got it!

1954
02:09:11,518 --> 02:09:13,353
Mari! Get Shinji!

1955
02:09:13,353 --> 02:09:14,688
Of course!

1956
02:09:14,688 --> 02:09:16,289
I'll definitely bring him home.

1957
02:09:16,523 --> 02:09:18,525
Please! Ugh!

1958
02:09:29,569 --> 02:09:32,439


1959
02:09:38,712 --> 02:09:43,116
While I'm still unable to meet with Yui,
the new Spear was brought here.

1960
02:09:44,150 --> 02:09:45,251
Unfortunate.

1961
02:09:48,788 --> 02:09:51,958
Mother, it's the only thing
you can do.

1962
02:09:52,325 --> 02:09:54,627
Sorry Ryoji.

1963
02:09:54,894 --> 02:10:00,867


1964
02:10:06,072 --> 02:10:08,641
Thank you, Misato.

1965
02:10:09,642 --> 02:10:15,749
Shinji, you have grown up to be able to
accept the thoughts and death of others.

1966
02:10:17,484 --> 02:10:20,954
<As material for
the reconstruction of Yui, >

1967
02:10:21,321 --> 02:10:26,526
< to the end, I didn't understand
whether Shinji was necessary or not.>

1968
02:10:27,360 --> 02:10:30,664
<With the fulfillment of my desire,
comes a reward.>

1969
02:10:31,197 --> 02:10:34,100
<I felt the child was
a punishment for me.>

1970
02:10:34,868 --> 02:10:40,807
<I was convinced that not meeting, nor having
a relation with the child, was my atonement.>

1971
02:10:41,741 --> 02:10:45,812
<I believed that way would even
be better for the child.>

1972
02:10:55,655 --> 02:11:07,434


1973
02:11:07,534 --> 02:11:10,770
I'm sorry, Shinji.

1974
02:11:12,405 --> 02:11:13,573
I see...

1975
02:11:14,607 --> 02:11:17,644
Is that where you were, Yui?

1976
02:11:17,744 --> 02:11:18,578


1977
02:11:30,657 --> 02:11:32,225
Ikari Gendo.

1978
02:11:32,225 --> 02:11:35,895
He is the Center of Instrumentality
this time, the origin of the circle.

1979
02:11:36,329 --> 02:11:37,964
I'll take over from here.

1980
02:11:38,698 --> 02:11:41,835
Ikari Shinji,
what do you wish for?

1981
02:11:42,235 --> 02:11:45,238
I'm good.
Even if there's pain, I think it's alright.

1982
02:11:45,872 --> 02:11:48,808
More than myself,
I want to help Asuka and everyone else.

1983
02:11:48,808 --> 02:11:50,210


1984
02:11:50,310 --> 02:11:53,780
That's right.
You were already recovering,

1985
02:11:53,780 --> 02:11:57,017
not in the Imaginary, but within Reality,

1986
02:11:57,517 --> 02:11:58,651
Yes.

1987
02:11:59,085 --> 02:12:02,188
I want to make right what father did.

1988
02:12:02,822 --> 02:12:04,357
Asuka.

1989
02:12:05,692 --> 02:12:08,662
I don't know my papa,
mama is not here either.

1990
02:12:09,562 --> 02:12:13,433
So you don't need anyone, Asuka.

1991
02:12:16,536 --> 02:12:19,272
<There's no one
and I'll make it right.>

1992
02:12:20,173 --> 02:12:22,475
<If I don't do that, it will be painful.>

1993
02:12:23,209 --> 02:12:25,745
<Because living is painful.>

1994
02:12:30,917 --> 02:12:32,619
<I'll pilot the Eva.>

1995
02:12:54,374 --> 02:12:57,410
<Even if I'm disliked by people,
even if they bad-mouth me, >

1996
02:12:57,877 --> 02:12:59,612
< it doesn't matter,
as long as I pilot the Eva.>

1997
02:12:59,612 --> 02:13:01,915
<There's no value to me other than that.>

1998
02:13:03,950 --> 02:13:08,188
I don't need anyone,
I have a strong body and mind.

1999
02:13:08,288 --> 02:13:12,892
<So praise me, accept me!>

2000
02:13:13,460 --> 02:13:15,528
<Give me a place to belong to!>

2001
02:13:16,830 --> 02:13:18,832
<I'm truly lonely.>

2002
02:13:20,567 --> 02:13:23,036


2003
02:13:23,370 --> 02:13:25,005
(Gendo) Wow.
(Yui) Haha.

2004
02:13:26,606 --> 02:13:31,077
<I really just wanted a pat on the head.>

2005
02:13:31,611 --> 02:13:42,022


2006
02:13:42,022 --> 02:13:43,256
Phew.

2007
02:13:44,290 --> 02:13:45,792
It's fine.

2008
02:13:45,892 --> 02:13:48,862
Asuka is Asuka.
That is enough.

2009
02:13:48,995 --> 02:13:49,829


2010
02:13:58,938 --> 02:14:00,907
Was I asleep?

2011
02:14:02,809 --> 02:14:03,943
Stupid Shinji.

2012
02:14:04,477 --> 02:14:06,646
I'm glad we could meet again.

2013
02:14:07,547 --> 02:14:09,349
I just wanted to tell you this.

2014
02:14:10,350 --> 02:14:13,286
Thank you,
for telling me "I like you".

2015
02:14:14,354 --> 02:14:17,190
I also liked you, Asuka.

2016
02:14:17,290 --> 02:14:18,491


2017
02:14:22,295 --> 02:14:25,198
Goodbye, Asuka.
Say hi to Kensuke.

2018
02:14:25,298 --> 02:14:27,100
Princess, be well.

2019
02:14:27,200 --> 02:14:27,901


2020
02:14:34,107 --> 02:14:37,644
She is gone.
Shinji, won't you be lonely?

2021
02:14:37,777 --> 02:14:40,080
I'll be alright.

2022
02:14:40,380 --> 02:14:42,949
Now it's your turn, Kaworu.

2023
02:14:44,651 --> 02:14:49,322
I remember.
I have come here many times and met you.

2024
02:14:49,622 --> 02:14:52,359
Because your name
is written into the "Book of Life".

2025
02:14:52,525 --> 02:14:53,860
We'll keep meeting indefinitely.

2026
02:14:54,527 --> 02:14:57,697
I am you.
We're the same.

2027
02:14:58,231 --> 02:15:02,535
That's why I was drawn to you,
I wanted to make you happy.

2028
02:15:03,036 --> 02:15:07,140
Yeah.
Kaworu, you resemble my father.

2029
02:15:07,240 --> 02:15:09,476
That's why we piloted the same Eva.

2030
02:15:10,210 --> 02:15:12,779
You're somewhat different than usual,
Shinji.

2031
02:15:13,446 --> 02:15:14,781
Will you not cry?

2032
02:15:14,881 --> 02:15:18,785
No. With tears,
I can only save myself.

2033
02:15:19,619 --> 02:15:22,522
Even if I cry, I can't save anyone else.

2034
02:15:23,490 --> 02:15:26,059
So I won't cry anymore.

2035
02:15:26,159 --> 02:15:29,696
I see.
You have already grown up.

2036
02:15:29,796 --> 02:15:32,198
Though I'll be a bit lonely, it's alright.

2037
02:15:32,766 --> 02:15:38,038
Kaworu, I will get rid of your Eva,
Unit 13.

2038
02:15:38,505 --> 02:15:41,408
Yeah, you can throw it away.

2039
02:15:42,042 --> 02:15:45,745
I'm sorry.
I misunderstood your happiness.

2040
02:15:46,413 --> 02:15:50,583
Yes, that was your happiness,
Commander Nagisa.

2041
02:15:51,618 --> 02:15:54,254
<Don't you want Shinji's happiness?>

2042
02:15:54,621 --> 02:15:58,024
<I wanted to make you happy.>

2043
02:16:00,393 --> 02:16:03,530
<The only thing that can erase my existence
is vacuum decay>

2044
02:16:03,897 --> 02:16:07,600
<So I will have to
forever repeat my part>

2045
02:16:07,701 --> 02:16:11,204
<within the prescribed circular story.>

2046
02:16:22,349 --> 02:16:24,984
It's a magic formula
to become good friends.

2047
02:16:28,455 --> 02:16:33,493
I desire a world of complementarity.
You never change, Shinji.

2048
02:16:33,994 --> 02:16:39,032
Because of that you choose him,
you wrote his name in the Book of Life.

2049
02:16:39,432 --> 02:16:42,002
Thank you.
I was also saved by Ryo.

2050
02:16:42,369 --> 02:16:44,404
It's an honour, Commander Nagisa.

2051
02:16:44,504 --> 02:16:48,141
I don't like that, Ryo.
Please start calling me "Kaworu".

2052
02:16:48,475 --> 02:16:51,745
Not yet, Commander Nagisa.

2053
02:16:52,445 --> 02:16:55,348
The shore is the space between
the sea and the land.

2054
02:16:55,648 --> 02:16:59,019
He is the first Angel,
he'll become the 13th Angel.

2055
02:16:59,119 --> 02:17:02,322
It's a name very much like you,
who weaves the threads of humanity.

2056
02:17:03,156 --> 02:17:05,325
You've carried out your duty well.

2057
02:17:05,625 --> 02:17:08,862
Now, even if you hand it over to him,
it should be fine.

2058
02:17:12,699 --> 02:17:16,870
What about working the fields
with Katsuragi in your old age?

2059
02:17:18,938 --> 02:17:22,942
Yeah, that's also good.

2060
02:17:23,043 --> 02:17:25,278


2061
02:17:28,648 --> 02:17:32,018
You're the only one left, Ayanami.

2062
02:17:33,153 --> 02:17:34,521
I'm good here.

2063
02:17:34,621 --> 02:17:38,525
The other you has already found
a place to belong to that isn't here.

2064
02:17:39,159 --> 02:17:42,796
When Asuka comes back, I think
she too will find a new place to belong.

2065
02:17:43,496 --> 02:17:48,268
Ikari, I wanted for you the happiness
of not piloting the Eva.

2066
02:17:48,501 --> 02:17:49,669
I know.

2067
02:17:50,036 --> 02:17:53,473
That's why this isn't the place.
There's a way to live for you.

2068
02:17:54,307 --> 02:17:55,275
Really?

2069
02:17:55,275 --> 02:17:56,276
Really.

2070
02:17:56,743 --> 02:18:00,146
I have also chosen a way to live
without piloting the Eva.

2071
02:18:01,114 --> 02:18:04,284
I won't turn back space and time, just...

2072
02:18:04,818 --> 02:18:07,620
I'll just rewrite it to a
"good world without EVA"

2073
02:18:08,488 --> 02:18:11,524
To a new world people can live in.

2074
02:18:12,459 --> 02:18:16,129
A new creation of the world.
Neon Genesis.

2075
02:18:16,696 --> 02:18:17,664
Yes.

2076
02:18:18,665 --> 02:18:21,401
Besides, Mari will come to get me later.

2077
02:18:21,868 --> 02:18:23,236
So don't worry.

2078
02:18:23,903 --> 02:18:26,239
Right, I understand.

2079
02:18:27,741 --> 02:18:30,443
Thank you, Ikari.

2080
02:18:30,443 --> 02:18:31,411
Yeah...

2081
02:18:31,811 --> 02:18:34,547


2082
02:18:36,116 --> 02:18:38,351
I will try, Ayanami.

2083
02:18:39,185 --> 02:18:41,021
